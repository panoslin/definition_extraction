' Connect components
Input --> POSEmb
WordEmb --> BiLSTM
POSEmb --> BiLSTM : "concatenated\nembeddings"
BiLSTM --> FLSTM : "processes forward context"
BiLSTM --> BLSTM : "processes backward context"
FLSTM --> GCN : "forward contextual embeddings"
BLSTM --> GCN : "backward contextual embeddings"
GCN --> CRF : "syntactic enriched\nembeddings"
GCN --> MaxPooling : "embeddings for\nsentence-level"
MaxPooling --> FFNN : "aggregates features"
FFNN --> Softmax : "computes probabilities"
Softmax --> ClassOutput : "Term-Definition pair exist or not"
CRF --> SeqOutput : "BIO tags for each word"

' Add some notes
'note right of FFNN : Consists of two layers\nand processes pooled\nfeatures for classification
'note right of Softmax : Normalizes output to\na probability distribution\nover classes
