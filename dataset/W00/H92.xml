				<sentence>For this purpose , for each bracketed string c = ( w , B ) we define the auxiliary function 1 if ( i , j ) does not overlap any b 6 B 6 ( i , j ) = 0 otherwise For each bracketed sentence c in the training corpus , the inside probabilities of longer spans of c can be computed from those for shorter spans by the following recurrence equations : I~ ( i1 , i ) = Up , ~ where c = ( w , B ) and bm = wi ( 2 ) I ; ( i'k ) = 5 ( i'k ) E E Bp , q , rI~ ( i , j ) I , ~ ( j , k ) ( 3 ) q , r i &lt; j &lt; k Equation ( 3 ) computes the expected relative frequency of derivations of ~wk from Ap compatible with the bracketing B of c = ( w , B ) . The multiplier 5 ( i , k ) is 0 just in case ( i , k ) overlaps some span in B , which is exactly when Ap can not derive iwk compatibly with B. Similarly , the outside probabilities for shorter spans of c can be computed from the inside probabilities and the outside probabilities for longer spans by the following recurrence : 1 ifp=l O $ ( 0,1cl ) = 0 otherwise. ( 4 ) Or ( i , k ) = i -- 1 + q~r kj -- k+x ( 5 ) Once the inside and outside probabilities computed for each sentence in the corpus , the reestimated probability of binary rules , /Jp , q , r , and the reestimated probability of unary rules , ( /p , m , are computed using the following reestimation formulae , which are just like the standard ones \ [ 2 , 5 , 4\ ] except for the use of bracketed strings instead of unbracketed ones : l ( Bp , q , rX~ ( i , j ) ) Z × Bp , q , r : c6C O~i &lt; j &lt; k_ &lt; \ [ w\ [ I , ~ ( j , k ) O~ ( i , k ) ( 6 ) EP ; /PO cEC 1 ~p , rn ~ cEC : l &lt; i &lt; \ [ c\ [ , ¢- ( w , B ) , wi-b.

The numerator of ( 6 ) estimates the probability that a compatible derivation of a bracketed string in C will involve rule Ap -- ~ Aq At , while the numerator of ( 7 ) estimates the probability that a compatible derivation of a string in C will rewrite Ap to bin. Thus ( 6 ) estimates the probability that a rewrite of Ap in a compatible derivation of a bracketed string in C will use rule Ap ~ Aq At , and ( 7 ) estimates the probability that an occurrence of Ap in a compatible derivation of a string in in C will be rewritten to bin. Clearly , these are the best current estimates for the binary and unary rule probabilities. The process is then repeated with the reestimated probabilities until the increase in the estimated probability of the training text given the model becomes negligible , or , what amounts to the same , the decrease in the cross entropy estimate ( log probability ) ElogProb ( c ) E log I\ [ ( 0 , Icl ) He ( C ) = tee = tee ( 8 ) eEC cEC becomes negligible. Note that for comparisons with the original algorithm , we should use the cross entropy of the unbracketed text with respect to the grammar , not ( 8 ) . The following experiments , although preliminary , give some support to our earlier suggested advantages of the inside-outside algorithm for partially bracketed corpora. We start with a formal-language example used by Lari and Young \ [ 4\ ] in a previous evaluation of the insideoutside algorithm. In this case , training on a bracketed 124 corpus can lead to a good solution while no reasonable solution is found training on raw text only. Then , using a naturally occurring corpus and its partially bracketed version provided by the Penn Treebank , we compare the bracketings assigned by grammars inferred from raw and from bracketed training material with the Penn Treebank bracketings. Together , the experiments support the view that training on bracketed corpora can lead to better convergence , and the resulting grammars agree better with linguistic judgments of sentence structure. We consider first an artificial language discussed by Lari and Young \ [ 4\ ] . Our training corpus consists of 100 sentences in the palindrome language L over two symbols a and b L = { ww a I we { a , b } ' } . randomly generated with the SCFG S°~AC S°~BD S°~AA S °~ BB C~SA D -~ SB B -L b The initial grammar consists of all possible CNF rules over five nonterminals and the terminals a and b ( 135 rules ) , with a random assignment of initial probabilities. As shown in Figure 1 , with an unbracketed training set the log probability remains almost unchanged after 40 iterations ( from 1.57 to 1.43 ) and no useful solution is found. In contrast , with the same training set fully bracketed , the log probability of the inferred grammar computed on the raw text decreases rapidly ( 1.57 initially , 0.87 after 22 iterations ) . Similarly , the cross entropy estimate of the bracketed text with respect to the grammar improves rapidly ( 2.85 initially , 0.87 after 22 iterations ) .
