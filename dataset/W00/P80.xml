The indexing scheme is manifest in the use of the functions &lt; TOK &gt; and &lt; NEXTTOIC , . It is important to be able to predict what a token will be , since in a parallel architecture several productions may be collaborating in building this expectation structure. Type-token and category membership searches are usually carried out within the interpreter itself. The exclamation point prefix on subelements , as in ! WORD above , causes the matcher to perform an ISA search for candidate tokens which the decision The matcher is itself dynamically altered with respect to ISA knowledge as new tokens are created , and by explicit ISA knowledge manipulation on the part of specialized productions. This has certain computational advantages in keeping the match process efficient 2. The use of very many tokens , as implied by the above example , is important if one wants to explore the coordination of different processes in a parallel architecture. The next production would fire if the word following the determiner were an adjective : ( ( IWORD : HAS IDETERHINER-TAIL ) ( DETERMINER-TAIL : HAS IWORO-EXPECTATION ) ( WORD-EXPECTATION : IS IIWORD ) ( % WORD : IS IADJECTIVE ) -- &gt; ( &lt; SPEW &gt; from ( WORD-EXPECTATION : IS IWORO ) to ( WORD-EXPECTATION : IS 1WORD ) -I ( WORD-EXPECTATION : IS ( &lt; NEXTTOK &gt; WORD ) ) ) The number prefixes , as in `` 1WORD '' , are tokens local to the production that just serve to indicate different knowledge base tokens are sought not what their knowledge base tokens should be .</sentence>
