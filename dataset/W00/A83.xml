As these examples sho~ the anal yser 's representations combine expressive power with structural simplicity. Further , the power of the semantic category primitives used to identify text message patterns means that it is possible to achieve far mcre semantic analysis cf a question , far earlier in the frcnt end processing , than can be achieved with frcnt ends conforming tc the Koncllge model. The effectiveness cf the anal yser as a general natural-language prccesslng device has been demcnstrated by its successful application to a range of natural language processing tasks. There is , however , a price to pay , in the database context , for its generality. Natural language makes ocn=acn use of vague concepts ( `` have '' , `` do '' ) , almost content-empty markers ( `` be e , `` of '' ) , and opaque constructions such as compound nouns. Clearl~ front ends where domainspecific information can provide leverage in interpreting these input text items have advantages. and it is not clear how a principled solution to the problems they present can be achieved within the framework of a general-purpose anal yser of the kind described. To provide a domain-specific interpretation of , for example , compounds like `` supplier city '' , an interface would have to be provided oharaeterising domain k~owledge in the semantic terms familiar to the parser , and guaranteeing the provision of explicit structural charaoterlsations of the text constituent which would be available for further exploitation by the parser. To avoid invoking domain knowledge in this way in analysis we have been obliged to accept questicn interpretations which are incomplete in limited respects. That is , we push the ordinary semantic analysis procedures as far as they will go , accepting that they may leave 'dummy ' markers in the dependency structure and compound nominals with ambiguous member words and no explicit extracted structure. B. The Extractor nile the meaning representations constructed by the natural language analyser are general and informative enough to be able to support dlfferent tasks in different applications for different domains , they are not necessarily the best fcrm cf representation for question answering , and specifically for addressing a coded database. After the initial determination of question meaning. therefore , the question is subjected to taskoriented , though not yet domainand databaseoriented , processing. Imposing domain world and database organisatlon restrictions on the question at this stage would be premature , since it cculd ecmplloate or even inhibit possible later inference operations. The idea cf providing a system ccmponent addressing a general linguistic task , withcut throwing away any detailed information not in fact needed for scme specific instance cf that task , like natural language distinctions between quantifiers ignored by the database system , is also an attractive one. The extractor thus emphasises the fact that the input text is a questicn , but carries the detailed semantic information provided by the analyser forward fcr exploitation in the translation phase cf the processing. A gccd way to achieve a question formulation abstracted from the low-level crganisaticn cf the database is to interpret the user 's input as a formal quer~ However our extractor , unlike the equivalent processors described by ( Wocds 1972 ) . ( Warren and Pereira 1981 ) and ( Grcsz et al 1982 ) , does not make any use cf domain-dependent in fcrmaticn , but constructs a icgic expression whose variable ranges and predicate relaticnships are defined in terms cf 83 the general semantic primitives used for ccnstructlng the input question meaning representation. The logic representation of the question which is output by the extractor highlights the search aspects cf the input , formalising them so that the subsequent processes which will eventually generate the search specification for the database management system can locate and focus on them easily ; at the same time , the semantic richness of the original meaning representation is maintained to facilitate the later domain-crlented translation operations. The syntax of the logic representation closely follc~ that defined by ( Wocds 1978 ) : ( For &lt; quantifier &gt; &lt; variable &gt; / &lt; range &gt; : &lt; restrictions on variable &gt; &lt; prcpcslticn &gt; ) , where each cf the restrictions , or the proposition , can themselves be quantified expressions .</sentence>

				<sentence>~ ~or ; &lt; in~ system. This paper 'Je~crihes the overall system design snecif~c~Cion t ) .~n£cn we are currently working. ~n cite basic design of the system we attempt to incorporate as much as possible Features of far , escale ~ systems ~hac have proved to be desirable or effective. Thus. Bede is mul~ilinBual by , ~csi ( zn. alqorithms and linRuistic data are striccl~ separated , and the system \ [ s desiRned in ~ore oless independent modules.

Limitations on ~ncore and periohera\ [ storage are important considerations in the system design. In large genera\ [ purpose , HT systems , i= is necessary to assume that faiture to translate the given input correctty is generally not due to incorrectly ~ormed input , bu~ to \ [ nsufficientJy elaborated ~ranslacion algorithms. This is particularly due to =wo problems : the lexical problem of choice of appropriate translation equivalents , and the strategic problem of e~fec~ive analysis of the wide range of syntactic patterns Eound in nacural language. The reduction of these problems via ~he notions of '' controlled vocabu\ [ ary and restricted syntax seems particularly appropriate in the microprocessor environment , since the alternative of makin~ a system |n~tnitely extendable \ [ s probably no~ feasible , Given these constra/nts , it seems feasible to achieve cranstacion via an InCerltngua. ~n ~hich the canonicat structures from the source lan=ua~e are mapped directly onto those of the target language ( s ) , avoidin R any language-pair oriented 'transfer ' sta~e. Translation thus cakes place in ~wu puase~= anaiysls ot source ~ext an~ synthesis of target text. A. Incorporation of recent desL~n ortncio\ [ es ~odern ~ system design can be char~cterLsed hv three principles thac have proved Co be desirable and effective ( Lehmann eta\ [ , tg~ } o : I-\ ] ) : each of these is adhered co in the desiRn oF Rede. Bede Es mutt\ [ lingual by design : early `` ! T systems were designed with specific lan~uaBe-oatrs in mind , and translation algorithms were elaborated on this basis. The main conseouence of this was that source lan~uaRe analysis ~¢as effected within the perspective of the B~ven target \ [ anguaRe , and was therefore often of little or no use on the addition into the system of a further language ( of. ~in~ , IORI:12 ; ~ : in~ Perschke , 1982:28 ) . In Bede , there is a strict separation of algorithms and \ [ inguiscic data : oarlv `` T ~y~ccms '~ere quite sin~n\ [ y 'translation nrc~ra : ~s ' , tnd ~nv underlying linguistic theory which might have been present was inextricably bound up with the program itself. This clearly entailed the disadvantage that any modification of the system had to be done by a skilled programmer ( of. Johnson , IgRO : IAO ) . Furthermore , the side-effects of apparently quite innocent modifications were often quite farreaching and difficult to trace ( see for example Boscad , lq82:130 ) , Although this has only recently become an issue in HT ( e.g. Vauquois , 1979 : I.3 ; 1981=10 ) , it has of course for a long time been standard practice in other areas of knowledge-based programming ( Newell , 1973 ; Davis &amp; King , 1977 ) . The third principle now current in MT and to be incorporated in Bede is that the translation process should be modular. This approach was a feature of the earliest 'second generation ' systems ( of. Vauquois , 1975:33 ) , and is characterised by the general notion that any complicated computational task is best tackled by dividing it up into smaller more or less independent sub-casks which communicate only by means of a strictly defined interface protocol ( Aho et al , 1974 ) . This is typically achieved in the bit environment by a gross division of the translation process into analysis of source language and synthesis of target language , possibly with an intermediate transfer sca~e ( see ! .D below ) , with these phases in turn sub-divided , for example into morphological , lexical and syntactico-semantlc modules. This modularity may be reflected both in the linguistic organisation of the translation process and in the provision of software devices specifically tailored to the relevant sub-task ( Vauquois , 1975:33 ) . This is the case in Bede , where for each sub-task a grammar interpreter is provided which has the property of being no more powerful than necessary for the task in question. This contrasts with the approach taken in TAt~-H~c~o ( TAUM , Ig73 ) , where a single general-purpose device ( Colmerauer 's ( 1970 ) 'O-Systems ' ) is orovided , with the associated disadvantage that for some 'simple ' tasks the superfluous power of the device means that processes are seriously uneconomical. Bede incorporates five such 'grammar types ' with associated individual formalisms and processors : these are described in detail in the second half of this paper. B. The microproce , ssor environment ! t is in the microprocessor basis that the principle interest in this system lies , and , as mentioned above , the main concern is the effects of the restrictions that the environment imposes. Development of the Bede prototype is presently caking place on ZRO-based machines which provide 6Ak bytes of in-core memory and 72Ok bytes of peripheral store on two 5-I/~ '' double-sided double-density floppy disks. The intention is that any commercial version of Bede would run on more powerful processors with larger address space , since we feel chat such machines will soon rival the nopularity of the less powerful ZRO 's as the standard desk-cop hardware. Pro~rarzninR so far has been in Pascal- '' ( Sorcim , 197q ) , a Pascal dialect closely resembling UCSD Pascal , but we are conscious of the fact that both C ( Kernighan &amp; Ritchie , 1978 ) and BCPL ( Richards &amp; WhitbyStrevens , Ig7g ) may be more suitable for some of the software elements , and do not rule out completing the prototype in a number of languages. This adds the burden of designing compatible datastructures and interfaces , and we are currently investigating the relative merits of these languages. Portability and efficiency seem to be in conflict here. Microprocessor-based MT contrasts sharply with the mainframe-based activity , where the significance of problems of economy of storage and efficiency of programs has decreased in recent years. The possibility of introducing an element of human interaction with the system ( of. Kay , Ig80 ; Melby , 1981 ) is also highlighted in this environment. Contrast systems like SYSTRAN ( Toma , 1977 ) and GETA ( Vauquois , 1975 , lq7g ; Boiler &amp; Nedobejkine , IggO ) which work on the principle of large-scale processing in batch mode. Our experience so far is chat the economy and efficiency in data-structure design and in the elaboration of interactions between programs and data and between different modules is of paramount importance. While it is relatively evident thac large-scale HT can be simulated in the microprocessor environment , the cost in real time is tremendous : entirely new design ~nd implementation strategies seem co be called for. The ancient skills of the programmer that have become eroded by the generosity afforded by modern mainframe configurations become highly valued in this microprocessor application. C. Controlled vocabulary and restricted sync @ x The state of the art of language processing is such chat the analysis of a significant range of syntactic patterns has been shown to be possible , and by means of a number of different approaches. Research in this area nowadays is concentrated on the treatment of more problematic constructions ( e.g. Harcus , lqgO ) . This observation has led us tO believe that a degree of success in a small scale MT project can be achieved via the notion of restricting the complexity of acceptable input , so that only constructions that are sure tc ne Correctly analysed are permitted. This notion of restricted syntax ~ has been tried with some success in larger systems ( cf. Elliston , IGYn : Lawson , 107q:81f ; Somers &amp; HcNaught , I9~O : ao~ , resulting both in more accurate translation , and in increased legibility from t~e human point of view. AS Elliston points out , the development ef strict guidelines for writers leads not only t : the use of simpler constructions , but also to =he avoidance of potentially ambiguous text. In either case , the benefits for ~ are obvious. Less obvious however is the acceptability of such constraints ; yet 'restricted syntax ' need noc imply 'baby talk ' , and a reasonably extensive range of constructions can be included. Just as problems of syntactic analysis ca~ : e ( . alleviated by imposing some degree of contrn~ over 150 the syntactic complexity of the input , so the corresponding problem of lexical disambiguation chat large-scale HT systems are faced with can be eased by the notion of controlled vocabulary. A major problem for PIT is the choice of appropriate translation equivalents at the lexical level , a choice often determined by a variety of factors at all linguistic levels ( syntax , semantics , pragmatics ) . In the field of mulCilingual terminology , this problem has been tackled via the concept of terminological equivalence ( WUster , 1971 ) : for a given concept in one language , a translation in another language is established , these being considered by definition to be in oneto-one correspondence. In the case of Beds , where the subject-matter of the texts to be translated is fixed , such an approach for the 'technical terms ' in the corpus is clearly feasible ; the notion is extended as far as possible to general vocabulary as well. For each concept a single term only is permitted , and although the resulting style may appear less mature ( since the use of near synonyms for the sake of variety is not permitted ) , the problems described above are somewhat alleviated. Polysemy is noC entirely avoidable , but if reduced co a bare minimum , and permitted only in specific and acknowledged circumstances , the problem becomes more easily manageable. D. Interlin~ua A significant dichotomy in PIT is between the 'transfer ' and 'tnterlingua ' approaches. The former can be characterised by the use of bilingual transfer modules which convert the results of the analysis of the source language into a representation appropriate for a specific target language. This contrasts wlth the interlingua avproach in which the result of analysis is passed directly co the appropriate synthesis module. It is beyond the scope of the present paper to discuss in detail the relative merits of the two approaches ( see Vauquois , i975 : l &amp; 2ff ; Hutchins , lq78 ) . I~ should however consider soma of the major obstacles inherent in the incerlingua approach. The development of an Interlingua for various purposes ( noc only translation ) has been the subject of philosophical debate for some years , and proposals for ~T have included the use of formalized natural language ( e.g. Hel'~uk , Ig7 &amp; ; Andreev , lg67 ) , artificial languages ( like ~soeranco ) , or various symbolic representations , ~hecher linear ( e.~. BUlcins , I061 ) or otherwise ( e.~. `` ~ilks , 1073 ) . Host of chess approaches are problematic however ( for a thorough discussion of the lncerlingua approach co ~ , see Often &amp; Pacak ( 1071 ) and Barnes ( ig83 ) ) . Nevertheless , some incerlingua-based HT systems have been developed co a considerable degree : for example , the ~renohle team 's first attempts at wT cook this approach ( Veillon , 106R ) , while the TITUS system still in use ac the Ànscicut Textile de France ( Ducroc. Ig72 ; Zinge\ [ , 1~78~ is claimed to be ( ncerlin~u , l-based. 151 It seems that it can be assumed a priori thac an entirely language-independent theoretical representation of a given text is for all practical purposes impossible. A more realistic target seems to be a representation in which significant syntactic differences between the languages in question are neutralized so chat the best one can aim for is a languages-specific ( sic ) representation. This approach implies the definition of an Interlingua which cakes advantage of anything the languages in the system have in common , while accomodating their idiosyncrasies. This mains chat for • system which involves several fairly closely related languages the interlinsua approach is at least feasible , on the understanding that the introduction of a significantly different type of language may involve the complete redefinition of the Incerlingua ( Barnes , 1983 ) . ~rom the point of view of Beds , then , the common base of the languages involved can be used to great advantage. The notion of restricted syntax described above can be employed to filter out constructions chac cause particular problems for the chosen Interlingua representation. There remains however the problem of ~he representation of lexical items in the Interlingua. Theoretical approaches co this problem ( e.g. Andreev , 1967 ) seem quite unsatisfactory. BuC the notion of controlled vocabulary '' seems to offer a solution. If a oneco-one equivalence of 'technical ' terms can be achieved , this leaves only a relatively small area of vocabulary for which an incerlingual representation must be devised. It seems reasonable , on a small scale , co treat general vocaOuiary tn an enelagous way co technical vocabulary , in particular creating lexical items in one language that are ambiguous with respect co any of the ocher languages as 'homographs'. Their 'disambiguation ' must cake place in Analysis as there is no biltgual 'Transfer ' phase , and Synthesis is purely deterministic. While this approach would be quite unsuitable for a larRescale general purpose HT system , in the present context where the problem can be minimised ~c seems Co be a reasonable approach. Our own model for the Bede tnCerlingua has noc yet been finalised. We believe this co be an area for research and experimentation once the system software has been more fully developed. ~ur current hypothesis is chat the InterlinRua will cake the form of a canonical representation of the text in which valency-houndness and ( deep ) ~e will play a significant role. Sentential features such as tense and aspect will be capcured by 'universal ' system of values for the languages involved. This concepcion of an Interlingua clearly falls short of the language-independent pivot representation typically envisaged Ccf. Boitet &amp; NedobeJklne , 1980:2 ) , but we hope : o demonstrate chac it is sufficient for the languages in our system , and chat it could be adapted without significant difficulties to cater for the introduction of other ( related ) Western European languages. We feel chat research in chLs area will , when the time comes , be a siEniflcanc and valuable by-product of the project as a whole. II. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM DESIGN In this second half of the paper we present a description of the translation process in Bede , as it is currently envisaged. The process is divided broadly into two parts , analysis and synthesis , the interface between the two being provided by the Interlingua. The analysis module uses a Chart-like structure ( cf. Kaplan , 1973 ) and a series of grammars to produce from the source text the Incerlingua tree structure which serves as input to synthesis , where it is rearranged into a valid surface structure for the target language. The 'translation unit ' ( TU ) is taken co be the sentence , or equivalent ( e.g. section heading , title , figure caption ) . Full details of the rule formalisms are given in Somers ( Ig81 ) . A. Strln~ segmentation The TU is first subjected to a two-stage string-segmentation and 'lemmatlsation ' analysis. In the first stage it is compared word by word with a 'stop-list ' of frequently occurring words ( mostly function words ) ; words not found in the stop-list undergo string-segmentatlon analysis , again on a word by word basis. Stringsegmentation rules form a finite-state grammar of affix-stripping rules ( 'A-rules ' ) which handle mostly inflectional morphology. The output is a Chart with labelled arcs indicating lexical unit ( LU ) and possible interpretatio n o£ the stripped affixes , this 'hypothesis ' to be confirmed by dictionary look-up. By way of example , consider ( I~ , a possible French rule , which takes any word ending in -issons ( e.g. finissons or h4rissons ) and constructs an arc on the Chart recording the hypothesis that the word is an inflected form of an '-it ' verb ( i.e. finir or *h4rir ) . ( I ) V + `` -ISSONS '' ~ V ~ `` -IR '' \ [ PERS=I &amp; NUM=PLUR &amp; TENSE=PRES &amp; HOOD=INDIC\ ] At the end of dictionary look-up , a temporary 'sentence dictionary ' is created , consisting of copies of the dictionary entries for ( only ) those LUs found in the current TU. This is purely an efficiency measure. The sentence dictionary may of course include entries for homographs which will later be rejected. B. Structural analysis I. 'P-rules ' The chart then undergoes a two-stage structural analysts. In the first stage , context-sensitive augmented phrase-structure rules ( 'P-rules ' ) work towards creating a single arc spanning the entire TU. Arcs are labelled with appropriate syntactic class and syncactico-semantic feature information and a trace of the lower arcs which have been subsumed from which the parse tree can be simply extracted. The trivial P-rule ( 2 ) iS provided as an examnle. ( 2 ) &lt; NUM ( DET ) =NUM ( N ) &amp; GDR ( DET ) .INT.GDR ( N~ r.. ~ &gt; DET + N -~ NP &lt; GDR ( NP ) : =GDR ( N ) &amp; NUM ( NP 3 : =NLvM ( N ) • P-rules consist of 'condition stipulations ' , a 'geometry ' , and 'assignment stipulations'. The nodes of the Chart are by default identified by the value of the associated variable CLASS , though it is also possible to refer to a node by a local variable name and test for or assign the value of CLASS in the stipulations. Our rule formalisms are quite deliberately designed to reflect the formalisms of traditional linguistics. This formalism allows experimentation with a large number of different context-free parsing algorithms. We are in fact still experimenting in this area. For a similar investigation , though on a machine with significantly different time and space constraints , see Slocum ( 1981 ) . In the second stage of structural analysis , the tree structure implied by the labels and traces on these arcs is disjoined from the Char~ and undergoes general tree-Co-cree-transductions as described by 'T-rules ' , resulting in a single tree structure representing the canonical form of the TU. • The formalism for the T-rules is similar co that for the P-rules , except in the geometry part , where tree structures rather than arc sequences are defined. Consider the necessarily more complex ( though still simplified ) example ( 3~. which regularises a simple English passive. ( 3 ) &lt; LU ( AUX ) = '' BE '' &amp; PART ( V ) =PASTPART &amp; LU ( PREP ) = '' BY '' &amp; CASE ( NP { 2 } ) =ACE ? ; T &gt; S ( NP { I } * AUX V ÷ NP { 2 } ( PREP .</sentence>

				<definiens id="0">the overall system design snecif~c~Cion t ) .~n£cn we are currently working. ~n cite basic design of the system we attempt to incorporate as much as possible Features of far , escale ~ systems ~hac have proved to be desirable or effective. Thus. Bede is mul~ilinBual by , ~csi ( zn. alqorithms and linRuistic data are striccl~ separated , and the system \ [ s desiRned in ~ore oless independent modules. T~n ~\ [ cron'occssor environment means that ~ : r~r~l ~I '' siz~ ~ro ~ { ~norE , l~E : '4~ta ~cruccures 169 both dynamic ( created by and maniputated during the translation process ) and static ( dictionaries and linguistic rule packages ) are constrained co be as economical in terms of s¢oraBe space and access procedures as possible. Limitations on ~ncore and periohera\ [ storage are important considerations in the system design. In large genera\ [ purpose , HT systems , i= is necessary to assume that faiture to translate the given input correctty is generally not due to incorrectly ~ormed input , bu~ to \ [ nsufficientJy elaborated ~ranslacion algorithms. This is particularly due to =wo problems : the lexical problem of choice of appropriate translation equivalents , and the strategic problem of e~fec~ive analysis of the wide range of syntactic patterns Eound in nacural language. The reduction of these problems via ~he notions of '' controlled vocabu\ [ ary and restricted syntax seems particularly appropriate in the microprocessor environment , since the alternative of makin~ a system |n~tnitely extendable \ [ s probably no~ feasible , Given these constra/nts , it seems feasible to achieve cranstacion via an InCerltngua. ~n ~hich the canonicat structures from the source lan=ua~e are mapped directly onto those of the target language ( s ) , avoidin R any language-pair oriented 'transfer ' sta~e. Translation thus cakes place in ~wu puase~= anaiysls ot source ~ext an~ synthesis of target text. A. Incorporation of recent desL~n ortncio\ [ es ~odern ~ system design can be char~cterLsed hv three principles thac have proved Co be desirable and effective ( Lehmann eta\ [ , tg~ } o : I-\ ] ) : each of these is adhered co in the desiRn oF Rede. Bede Es mutt\ [ lingual by design : early `` ! T systems were designed with specific lan~uaBe-oatrs in mind , and translation algorithms were elaborated on this basis. The main conseouence of this was that source lan~uaRe analysis ~¢as effected within the perspective of the B~ven target \ [ anguaRe , and was therefore often of little or no use on the addition into the system of a further language ( of. ~in~ , IORI:12 ; ~ : in~ Perschke , 1982:28 ) . In Bede , there is a strict separation of algorithms and \ [ inguiscic data : oarlv `` T ~y~ccms '~ere quite sin~n\ [ y 'translation nrc~ra : ~s ' , tnd ~nv underlying linguistic theory which might have been present was inextricably bound up with the program itself. This clearly entailed the disadvantage that any modification of the system had to be done by a skilled programmer ( of. Johnson , IgRO : IAO ) . Furthermore , the side-effects of apparently quite innocent modifications were often quite farreaching and difficult to trace ( see for example Boscad , lq82:130 ) , Although this has only recently become an issue in HT ( e.g. Vauquois , 1979 : I.3 ; 1981=10 ) , it has of course for a long time been standard practice in other areas of knowledge-based programming ( Newell , 1973 ; Davis &amp; King , 1977 ) . The third principle now current in MT and to be incorporated in Bede is that the translation process should be modular. This approach was a feature of the earliest 'second generation ' systems ( of. Vauquois , 1975:33 ) , and is characterised by the general notion that any complicated computational task is best tackled by dividing it up into smaller more or less independent sub-casks which communicate only by means of a strictly defined interface protocol ( Aho et al , 1974 ) . This is typically achieved in the bit environment by a gross division of the translation process into analysis of source language and synthesis of target language , possibly with an intermediate transfer sca~e ( see ! .D below ) , with these phases in turn sub-divided , for example into morphological , lexical and syntactico-semantlc modules. This modularity may be reflected both in the linguistic organisation of the translation process and in the provision of software devices specifically tailored to the relevant sub-task ( Vauquois , 1975:33 ) . This is the case in Bede , where for each sub-task a grammar interpreter is provided which has the property of being no more powerful than necessary for the task in question. This contrasts with the approach taken in TAt~-H~c~o ( TAUM , Ig73 ) , where a single general-purpose device ( Colmerauer 's ( 1970 ) 'O-Systems ' ) is orovided , with the associated disadvantage that for some 'simple ' tasks the superfluous power of the device means that processes are seriously uneconomical. Bede incorporates five such 'grammar types ' with associated individual formalisms and processors : these are described in detail in the second half of this paper. B. The microproce , ssor environment ! t is in the microprocessor basis that the principle interest in this system lies , and , as mentioned above , the main concern is the effects of the restrictions that the environment imposes. Development of the Bede prototype is presently caking place on ZRO-based machines which provide 6Ak bytes of in-core memory and 72Ok bytes of peripheral store on two 5-I/~ '' double-sided double-density floppy disks. The intention is that any commercial version of Bede would run on more powerful processors with larger address space , since we feel chat such machines will soon rival the nopularity of the less powerful ZRO 's as the standard desk-cop hardware. Pro~rarzninR so far has been in Pascal- '' ( Sorcim , 197q ) , a Pascal dialect closely resembling UCSD Pascal , but we are conscious of the fact that both C ( Kernighan &amp; Ritchie , 1978 ) and BCPL ( Richards &amp; WhitbyStrevens , Ig7g ) may be more suitable for some of the software elements , and do not rule out completing the prototype in a number of languages. This adds the burden of designing compatible datastructures and interfaces , and we are currently investigating the relative merits of these languages. Portability and efficiency seem to be in conflict here. Microprocessor-based MT contrasts sharply with the mainframe-based activity , where the significance of problems of economy of storage and efficiency of programs has decreased in recent years. The possibility of introducing an element of human interaction with the system ( of. Kay , Ig80 ; Melby , 1981 ) is also highlighted in this environment. Contrast systems like SYSTRAN ( Toma , 1977 ) and GETA ( Vauquois , 1975 , lq7g ; Boiler &amp; Nedobejkine , IggO ) which work on the principle of large-scale processing in batch mode. Our experience so far is chat the economy and efficiency in data-structure design and in the elaboration of interactions between programs and data and between different modules is of paramount importance. While it is relatively evident thac large-scale HT can be simulated in the microprocessor environment , the cost in real time is tremendous : entirely new design ~nd implementation strategies seem co be called for. The ancient skills of the programmer that have become eroded by the generosity afforded by modern mainframe configurations become highly valued in this microprocessor application. C. Controlled vocabulary and restricted sync @ x The state of the art of language processing is such chat the analysis of a significant range of syntactic patterns has been shown to be possible , and by means of a number of different approaches. Research in this area nowadays is concentrated on the treatment of more problematic constructions ( e.g. Harcus , lqgO ) . This observation has led us tO believe that a degree of success in a small scale MT project can be achieved via the notion of restricting the complexity of acceptable input , so that only constructions that are sure tc ne Correctly analysed are permitted. This notion of restricted syntax ~ has been tried with some success in larger systems ( cf. Elliston , IGYn : Lawson , 107q:81f ; Somers &amp; HcNaught , I9~O : ao~ , resulting both in more accurate translation , and in increased legibility from t~e human point of view. AS Elliston points out , the development ef strict guidelines for writers leads not only t : the use of simpler constructions , but also to =he avoidance of potentially ambiguous text. In either case , the benefits for ~ are obvious. Less obvious however is the acceptability of such constraints ; yet 'restricted syntax ' need noc imply 'baby talk ' , and a reasonably extensive range of constructions can be included. Just as problems of syntactic analysis ca~ : e ( . alleviated by imposing some degree of contrn~ over 150 the syntactic complexity of the input , so the corresponding problem of lexical disambiguation chat large-scale HT systems are faced with can be eased by the notion of controlled vocabulary.
