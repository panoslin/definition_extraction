The underlying structures of the situations occurring in a certain problem world determine the organization of dialogue and its systems. A grammar of dialogue is a set of rules of dialogue. Rules of dialogue state how participants understand coherent dialogues , and specify the membership of the set of legal dialogues K , such that K ~ T , where T is the set of dialogues of any length. Rules of dial9gue define the class of coherent dialogue and their attached models. They contain the way contributions are put together.
