We can now add a new weak hypothesis ht 1 based on a feature in P ( 1 with a confidence value oct 1 . ht 1 and tit 1 are chosen to minimize the function n Zclo = Z exp ( -- , Yi ( g~ -l ( xi ) + c~tlh~ ( xl , i ) ) ) '' ( 8 ) i=1 We now define , for 1 &lt; i &lt; n , the following virtual distribution , As before , Zt 1 is a normalization constant. Equ. ( 8 ) can now be rewritten 5 as n Z Dtl ( i ) exp ( - , Yi~h~ ( xl , i ) ) ' i=l which is of the same form as the function Zt used in AdaBoost. Using the virtual distribution Dtl ( i ) and pseudo-labels ~ ) i , values for W0 , W+ and W_ can be calculated for each possible weak hypothesis ( i.e. , for each feature x E ,121 ) ; the weak hypothesis with minimal value for W0 + 2~+W_ can be chosen as before ; and the weight for this weak hypothesis c~t = ยฝ In \ w_ +~ ) can be calculated. This procedure is repeated for T rounds while alternating between the two classifiers. The pseudo-code describing the algorithm is given in Fig. 2. The CoBoost algorithm described above divides the function Zco into two parts : Zco = Zclo + Zc2o โข โข On each step CoBoost searches for a feature and a weight so as to minimize either Zclo or Zc2o .

Note , however , that there might be situations in which Zco in fact increases. One implementation issue deserves some elaboration. Note that in our formalism a weakhypothesis can abstain. In fact , during the first rounds many of the predictions of gl , 92 are zero. Thus corresponding pseudo-labels for instances on which 9j abstainare set to zero and these instances do not contribute to the objective function. Each learner is free to pick the labels for these instances. This allow the learners to `` bootstrap '' each other by filling the labels of the instances on which the other side has abstained so far. The CoBoost algorithm just described is for the case where there are two labels : for the named entity task there are three labels , and in general it will be useful to generalize the CoBoost algorithm to the multiclass case. Several extensions of AdaBoost for multiclass problems have been suggested ( Freund and Schapire 97 ; Schapire and Singer 98 ) . In this work we extended the AdaBoost.MH ( Schapire and Singer 98 ) algorithm to the cotraining case. AdaBoost.MH maintains a distribution over instances and labels ; in addition , each weak-hypothesis outputs a confidence vector with one confidence value for each possible label. We again adopt an approach where we alternate between two classifiers : one classifier is modified while the other remains fixed. Pseudo-labels are formed by taking seed labels on the labeled examples , and the output of the fixed classifier on the unlabeled examples. AdaBoost.MH can be applied to the problem using these pseudolabels in place of supervised examples. For the experiments in this paper we made a couple of additional modifications to the CoBoost algorithm. The algorithm in Fig. ( 2 ) was extended to have an additional , innermost loop over the ( 3 ) possible labels. The weak hypothesis chosen was then restricted to be a predictor in favor of this label. Thus at each iteration the algorithm is forced to pick features for the location , person and organization in turn for the classifier being trained. This modification brings the method closer to the DL-CoTrain algorithm described earlier , and is motivated by the intuition that all three labels should be kept healthily populated in the unlabeled examples , preventing one label from dominating -this deserves more theoretical investigation. We also removed the context-type feature type when using the CoBoost approach. This `` default '' feature type has 100 % coverage ( it is seen on every example ) but a low , baseline precision. When this feature type was included , CoBoost chose this default feature at an early iteration , thereby giving non-abstaining pseudo-labels for all examples , with eventual convergence to the two classifiers agreeing by assigning the same label to almost all examples. Again , this deserves further investigation. Finally , we would like to note that it is possible to devise similar algorithms based with other objective functions than the one given in Equ. ( 7 ) , such as the likelihood function used in maximum-entropy problems and other generalized additive models ( Lafferty 99 ) . We are currently exploring such algorithms. The Expectation Maximization ( EM ) algorithm ( Dempster , Laird and Rubin 77 ) is a common approach for unsupervised training ; in this section we describe its application to the named entity problem. A generative model was applied ( similar to naive Bayes ) with the three labels as hidden vari108 ! ables on unlabeled examples , and observed variables on ( seed ) labeled examples. The model was parameterized such that the joint probability of a ( label , feature-sei ) pair P ( Yi , xi ) is written as P ( Yi , xi ) = P ( Yi , Xil '' . Ximi ) mi = P ( yi ) P ( mi ) N P ( xij\ ] Yi ) j=l ( 9 ) The model assumes that ( y , x ) pairs are generated by an underlying process where the label is first chosen with some prior probability P ( Yi ) ; the number of features mi is then chosen with some probability P ( mi ) ; finally th~ features are independently generated with probabilities P ( xij \ [ Yi ) . We again assume a training set of n examples { xl ... Xn } where the first m examples have labels { Yl ... ym } , and the last ( n m ) examples are unlabeled. For the purposes of EM , the `` observed '' data is { ( xx , ya ) i ... ( Xm , Ym ) , Xm+l ... Xn } , and the hidden data is { ym+l ... Yn } . The likelihood of the observed data under the model is m n k l~ P ( yi , xl ) ร II ~ P ( y , xi ) i=1 i=m+l y=l ( 10 ) where P ( Yi , xi ) is defined as in ( 9 ) . Training under this model involves estimation of parameter values for P ( y ) , P ( m ) and P ( xly ) . The maximum likelihood estimates ( i.e. , parameter values which maximize 10 ) can not be found analytically , but the EM algorithm can be used to hill-climb to a local maximum of the likelihood function from some initial parameter settings. In our experiments we set the parameter values randomly , and then ran EM to convergence. Given parameter estimates , the label for a test example x is defined as f ( x ) = argum { ~xk } P ( x , y ) ( 11 ) We should note that the model in equation 9 is deficient , in that it assigns greater than zero probability to some feature combinations that are impossible. For example , the independence assumptions mean that the model fails to capture the dependence between specific and more general features ( for example the fact that the feature full'-string=New_York is always seen with the features contains ( New ) and Learning Algorithm Accuracy Accuracy ( Clean ) ( Noise ) Baseline EM ( Yarowsky 95 ) Yarowsky-cautious DL-CoTrain CoBoost 45.8 % 83.1 % 81.3 % 91.2 % 91.3 % 91.1 % 41.8 % 75.8 % 74.1 % 83.2 % 83.3 % 83.1 % Table 2 : Accuracy for different learning methods. The baseline method tags all entities as the most frequent class type ( organization ) . contains ( York ) and is never seen with a feature such as contains ( Group ) ) . Unfortunately , modifying the model to account for these kind of dependencies is not at all straightforward. 88,962 ( spelling , context ) pairs were extracted as training data. 1,000 of these were picked at random , and labeled by hand to produce a test set. We chose one of four labels for each example : location , person , organization , or noise where the noise category was used for items that were outside the three categories. The numbers falling into the location , person , organi z at i on categories were 186 , 289 and 402 respectively. 123 examples fell into the noise category. Of these cases , 38 were temporal expressions ( either a day of the week or month of the year ) . We excluded these from the evaluation as they can be easily identified with a list of days/months. This left 962 examples , of which 85 were noise. Taking Arc to be the number of examples an algorithm classified correctly ( where all gold standard items labeled no i s e were counted as being incorrect ) , we calculated two measures of accuracy : Nc Accuracy : Noise - ( 12 ) 962 Nc Accuracy : Clean ( 13 ) 962 85 See Tab. 2 for the accuracy ofthe different methods. Note that on some examples ( around 2 % of the test set ) CoBoost abstained altogether ; in these cases we labeled the test example with the baseline , organization , label.

				<definiens id="4">of the predictions of gl , 92 are zero. Thus corresponding pseudo-labels for instances on which 9j abstainare set to zero and these instances do not contribute to the objective function. Each learner is free to pick the labels for these instances. This allow the learners to `` bootstrap '' each other by filling the labels of the instances on which the other side has abstained so far. The CoBoost algorithm just described is for the case where there are two labels : for the named entity task there are three labels , and in general it will be useful to generalize the CoBoost algorithm to the multiclass case. Several extensions of AdaBoost for multiclass problems have been suggested ( Freund and Schapire 97 ; Schapire and Singer 98 ) . In this work we extended the AdaBoost.MH ( Schapire and Singer 98 ) algorithm to the cotraining case. AdaBoost.MH maintains a distribution over instances and labels ; in addition , each weak-hypothesis outputs a confidence vector with one confidence value for each possible label. We again adopt an approach where we alternate between two classifiers : one classifier is modified while the other remains fixed. Pseudo-labels are formed by taking seed labels on the labeled examples , and the output of the fixed classifier on the unlabeled examples. AdaBoost.MH can be applied to the problem using these pseudolabels in place of supervised examples. For the experiments in this paper we made a couple of additional modifications to the CoBoost algorithm. The algorithm in Fig. ( 2 ) was extended to have an additional , innermost loop over the ( 3 ) possible labels. The weak hypothesis chosen was then restricted to be a predictor in favor of this label. Thus at each iteration the algorithm is forced to pick features for the location , person and organization in turn for the classifier being trained. This modification brings the method closer to the DL-CoTrain algorithm described earlier , and is motivated by the intuition that all three labels should be kept healthily populated in the unlabeled examples , preventing one label from dominating -this deserves more theoretical investigation. We also removed the context-type feature type when using the CoBoost approach. This `` default '' feature type has 100 % coverage ( it is seen on every example ) but a low , baseline precision. When this feature type was included , CoBoost chose this default feature at an early iteration , thereby giving non-abstaining pseudo-labels for all examples , with eventual convergence to the two classifiers agreeing by assigning the same label to almost all examples.</definiens>

				<sentence>type 'Event ' and therefore subcategorlze for two obhques ( Obl ) the former must be Obj whereas the latter can be either Obj or Event These Obl can be optional ( Opt ) Acqmrers may specify the preposition ( head of the oblique or preposlUonal phrase ) For Instance , in the case of lather , once an acqulrer has mapped the word to the concept ' Father '' which is a Prop ( Property ) the acquisition tool presents the subcategorizatmn NObllOpt This allows the acquirer to select wluch prepositlon ( s ) can go with the range of Father ( in this case `` of '' will be selected ) This Information is important in generation For generation , one must specify , at acquisition tlme , whether or not one can say the bombing o/Iraq , the bombing of Iraq by the US ~ the bombing by the US It also helps in word sense dxsamblguation In the case of verbs , one can also define lexicosyntactic classes for different semantic classes For instance , in the case of ASSERTIVEACT the lexemes mapped to it will accept a comp clause ( e g he A 64 sazd ( that , ) he would come ) One class of aspectuals subcategonzes for nps ( e g I started a new book ) , xcomps ( e g I started reading/Tinting a new book ) , and accepts the intransitive alternation when the grammatical object is of type Event ( e g the surgery started very late ) 3 In this section , we briefly discuss how to extend a lexmon using denvatlonal morphology , and off the shelf resources such as WordNet ( Miller , 1990 ) to propagate the English lexicon with synonyms , and Levm 's database of subcategonzatlons and alternations for Enghsh verbs ( Levm , 1993 ) to encode syntactic information m the verb entries 4 Morphology We refer the reader to Vmgas et al ( 1996 ) for the details on this type of acquisition and theoretical background of Lexlcal Rules ( LRs ) To sketch this operation briefly , applying morpho semantic LRs to the entry for the Spanish verb comprar ( buy ) , our acquisition system produced automatically 26 new entries ( comprador-N1 ( buyer ) , comprable-Ad\ ] ( buyable ) , etc ) This includes creating new syntax , semantics and syntax-semantm mappings with correct subcategomzations and also the right semantics For instance , the lexmal entry for comprable will have the subcategonzatlon for predicative and attributive adjectives and the semantics adds the attribute FEASIBILITYATTRIBUTE to the basic meaning BuY of comprar ( Vmgas et al , 1996 ) describes about 100 morpho-semantlc LRs , which were applied to 1056 verb citation forms with 1,263 senses among them The rules helped acquire an average of 26 candidate new ~ntrms per verb sense This produced a total of 31,680 candidate entries , with an average of over 90 % and 85 % correctness in the assignment of syntax and semantics respectively LRs constitute a powerful tool to extend a core lexicon from a monohngual viewpoint We present other ways of extending lexicons , from monohngual ( next paragraph ) and multlhngual ( Section 5 ) perspectives 4 2 Using WordNet WordNet has been used as follows We extracted the synsets assooated with a lexeme using fuzzy string matches between , on the one hand , the value of the ontological concept ( e g , DESIRE ) , its defimtlon ( e g , for DESIRE `` to want something '' ) and the concept and definition of ~ts corresponding ISA concept ( e g , INTEND ) and , on the other hand , the direct hypernyms and hyponyms for the lexeme m 3See Vmgas et al ( 1999 ) for the details on the web raterfaces used for the acqulsltmn 4See Vlegas et al ( 1998 ) for more details WordNet synsets For instance , for the English verb expect , mapped to the ontological concept DESIRE our algorithm only kept one synset hope , expect , trust , deswe for expect and the following synsets for Its hypernyms wzsh , des : re , want The output of our automatlc procedure and manual filtering Is illustrated below for the ontological concept DESIRE , along with the synonyms from WordNet belonging to the same ontological class DESIRE want expect trust wish All these lexemes will be mapped to the concept DESIRE and minimally accept the same subcategomzatlons ( e g np-v-np-xcomp as in I want you to /eel comfortable ) We should mention that this step also Involved some manual filtering by acqulrers We used a machine-guided mode to help the acqulrer in this task This type of filtering was done very quickly , mainly due to the fact that WordNet is orgamzed on a semantic basis One of the major problems m using Levm 's database was filtering out homonyms , as classes in Levm 's database are defined on the basis of the same subcategonzatlon pattern ( as seen in alternations ) and not on a semantic basis , as shown by many researchers s The advantage of our approach is that ~t is semantic-based , this allows us to organize verbs into true ( frame-based ) semantic classes , with their associated sets of subcategonzatlons Therefore , we can pledlct that all velbs belonging to a particular semantra class Will have the Same syntactic behavior For instance , if one considers the serhantm class of aspectual verbs which selects a theme of type Event , e g begin , continue , finzsh , then one can minimally associate to any verb belonging to this semantic class the following subcategonzatlons ( a ) NP-V-NP m John began h : s homework , ( b ) NP-V-XCOMP John began to work//workzng Note that the reverse is not necessarily true verbs which accept ( a ) and ( b ) are not necessarily aspectuals , e g forget in I forgot the key or I forgot to brzng the key In thls sectlon , -we briefly address what can be generahzed to multiple languages The methodologms described here are part of what is needed to build 5Many experiments have resulted m a sumlar finding , as described In ( Dorr et al , 1997 ) , ( Dang et al , 1997 ) SamtD~z~er ( 1996 ) also showed that these classes do not apply easfly to French 65 a multi-purpose LKB while keeping the costs of acqmsltmn as low as possible By mapping lexemes to concepts , it is possible to create lexicons for dufferent languages , at a mmlmum cost , once a core lexicon has been acquired Th~s task can be further accelerated if one has access to blhngual d~ctmnames to semi-automate the translatmn task Finally , if one has access to a rlch structured ontology ( as is the case in Mlkrokosmos ) then dynamic procedures ( e g , generalization , speciahzatmn ) can help the acqulrer in `` filling '' the gap m the case of lexlco-semantm mismatches ( e g , cook , bake ~ cuwe ) Multflinguahty : Morpho : semantics All the LRs ( e g , LR2agent-o\ ] ) developed for Spanlsh can be used to extend other languages , even unrelated ones , in other words , these rules are language mdependent The morpho-semant , c aspect of the LRs is , however , specific to particular languages But , in order to benefit from the work done on morpho-semantlc LRs , we separated the assignmeat of affixes from the assignment of LRs In other words , if m Spanish LR~agent-of m ass~ghed to say the suffix -dot , by translating suffixes between languages , ( -dot -+ -cur in French ) , the French lexlcon can be extended m the same way ( comprador -- + acheteur ) Again , this work will necesmtate some manual checking , because of some overgeneration , which can not be accepted for generation But overall , one can use the same methodology , the same LRs and engine to produce new entries MultihnguahtY The subcategonzatlons attached to a lexeme have an even more idiosyncratic behavmr than lexlcal LRs But here agam , the rules we developed can be applied at least to family-related languages , and then filtered out by a human For mstance , the Spanish word comer has the pattern np-v-np associated to it ( e g Juan come una pera ) , so this same pattern will be attached to the translatmn of comer ( eat ) as m ( Juan eats a pear ) However , gomg from Spanish to English , one misses all the alternatmns ( Lewn , 1993 ) not common in Spanish such as John gave Mary a book The MIkrokosmos lexicon acqulmtlon group has acquired the following data Spanish lexicon 7,000 word sense entrms ( 35,000 word sense entries after applying the morpho-semantm lexlcal rules ) , Chinese lexicon about 3,000 word sense entries , and Enghsh , about 15,000 word sense entrms so far For instance , the acquisition of 15,000 word sense entries took one year and involved 50 % of the time of a computational hngmst ( to develop the methodology , train the acqulrers and design the GUIs ) , 50 acqmrer hours per week , 10 hours per week of a programmer to tmplement the GUIs , mamtam the tools and test the entries Our approach to the development of lex , cons differs from others m that our rules apply directly to semantlc frames and not to the basic forms of verbs Our methodology allows us to alleviate the burden of manual checking by applying linking rules directly on the semantics of the lexemes Some rules add discourse related features , such as focus m some alternations , e g , they zmproved the s~tuatwn -- + the s~tuatzon zmproved What is Important to evaluate is how much do we gam by using rules and other resources Today , ~t ~s still d~fficult to say exactly how much Adequately predicting the subcategonzatlons for a semantic class depends on its gram size the finergrained , the better the pred2ctwn wall be However , m NLP apphcatlons , where one Is constramed by tlme , only the semantics necessary for a particular application is acquired , which means that m many cases the semantms is left at a coarser grain s~ze than the one required to predict the subcategomzatlons In practice , we overgenerate some subcategortzatlons and need therefore to have them checked by humans This ~s why we have concentrated on a small set of rules Results on that trade-off issue have been reported in Vmgas et al ( 1998 ) Our experience in large-scale acqulsltmn of lexicons shows that Idiosyncrasies overrule many of our general rules This is mainly due to the fact that we need a more fine-gramed semantms than the one which is available now This , s not just a criticism of our framework , , t is a genelal fact that we all encounter when mvestlgatmg lexlcal semantics This might be due to the fact that we work m a synchronic perspective ( a highly recommended approachl ) , whereas language evolves constantly , thus creatmg `` artificial '' ldmsyncrasms In any case one can not avold them when butldmg a computatmnal semantic lexicon We have also learnt dunng the acquisition of the Mtkrokosmos lexmons that different acqulrers , who have been through the same Intensive tralmng , will arrive at the same numbel of meanings for a word , in more than 90 % of the cases The meaning of a word might differ , for different trained acqulrers , along ISA links Corpora also Influence the decision of the acqmrers , and here too we have seen some human `` mconsltencms '' which we thmk could be `` corrected '' automatically , as discussed in the followmg section 66 We are investigating the msue of taking into account mconmstent lex~cal descnptmns between the lexicon acqmrers by taking advantage of the semantm tarotmatron encoded in the ontology If we look at the following data and their subcategonzatlons ( 1 ) I fixed the meal \ [ NP1 , NP2\ ] ( 2 ) I fixed a sandwlch for you \ [ NP1 , NP2 , PP1\ ] ( 3 ) I fixed you a sandwich \ [ NP1 , NP3 , NP2\ ] where fix means PREPAREFOOD , then one must subcategonzatmns m between square brackets are assocmted to the lexmal ~tems mapped to A , B and C

, ARG3\ ] \ [ ARGI , haG2\ ] Looking at example ( 1 ) , and m absence of examples ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in the corpus , fix could easily be mapped into A or C , whereas with examples ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , and m absence of example ( 1 ) m the corpus , ~t could be easily mapped into A or B by the acqmrers We clmm that thin is of no importance as far as there are mechamsms to go from one to the other This requires to have access to semantic reformation The dmgram above is a computational hngumt construct and has no `` reality '' per se B and C are constructs which provide for every semantic class the different semantic patterns that a particular semantic class accepts , such as the pattern CREATEINGESTBENEF requires 3 semantm arguments ( AGENT , BENEFICIARY and THEME ) , whereas CREATEINGESTTHEME only reqmres 2 semantic arguments In this case , thin means that the BENEFICIARY IS optional , a fact the acqmrer `` failed '' to recogmze This diagram can be further specified for a particular natural language , where the required arguments are mapped to syntactic arguments and where lexlcal rules for a particular language provide the link between the different semantic patterns for a semantic class The dmgram below is for English where 6We g*ve the general diagram for CREATEINGEST events , as PREPAREFOOD is a subtype and will inherit all the properties of the semantic class CREATEINGEST The corpus can indeed Influence the way a lexicon acqmrer will do the mapping So if a lexicon acqmrer creates an unspecffied entry ( mapping fix on ( A ) , as opposed to ( B ) or ( C ) ) , dynamic mechamsms such as speclahzatlon or generahzatmn would enable the system to get to ( B ) and ( C ) from ( A ) and vice versa ( to ( A ) from ( B ) or ( C ) ) Moreover , ff a lexicon acqmrer decides to map to ( B ) instead of ( C ) or vine versa , then a lexmal rule ( LR ) between ( B ) and ( C ) will enable the system to go from ( B ) to ( C ) and wce versa In other words , although there are three potentrolly different ways of writing the lexlcon entry for fix for example sentences ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , these different ways of encoding fix should remain a virtual difference at processing t~me the system must encode mechanisms and rules to `` interpret '' and reconcile the different points of wew of different acqmrels This enables the system to process sentences ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) from any of the three p0tentml lexicon entries We beheve that an unportant msue m computational semantics m to study how lexicon entries could be dynamically changed to fit different

				<sentence>tinguish the verb classes ~ In exploring these quesUons , we focus on verb classlficaUon for several reasons Verbs are very important sources of knowledge in many language engineering tasks , and the relationships among verbs appear to play a major role m the orgamzatmn and use of this knowledge Knowledge about verb classes is crucml for lex , cal acqmsltton m support of language generation and machine translatmn ( Dolt , 1997 ) and document cl~sfficatmn ( Klavans and Kan , 1998 ) , yet manual classfficauon of large numbers of verbs is a difficult and resource intensive task ( Levm , 1993 Miller et al , 1990 , Dang et al , 1998 ) To address these issues , we suggest that one can tram an automatic classffier for verbs on the basts of staUstmal approxlmaUons to verb dlatheses We use dlatheses -- alternatmns m the expression of the arguments of the verb -- following Levm and Dorr , for two reasons Fnst , verb dlatheses are syntacuc cues one strong assumptmn regarding the nature of the representatmns under study semantic notmns and syntacuc notmns are correlated , at least m part This assurapuon is under debate ( Bnscoe and Copestake , 1995 , Levm , 1993 , Dorr and Jones , 1996 , Dorr , 1997 ) , but we adopt ~t here without further dlscussmn 15 ' โข to semantic classes , hence they can be more easily captured by corpus-based techniques Second , using verb d~atheses reduces no , se There ~s a certain consensus ( Bnscoe and Copestake , 1995 , Pustejovsky , 1995 , Palmer , 1999 ) that verb dmtheses are regular sense extensmns Hence focussing on thin type of classfficatmn allows one to abstract from the problem of word sense dmamb , guatmn and treat remdual d~fferences m word senses as no~se m the classfficatmn task We present an m-depth case study , m which we apply machine learning techmques to automaUcally classify a set of verbs based on d~stnbutmns of grammaucal indicators of dmtheses , extracted from a very large corpus We look at three very mterestmg classes of verbs unergaUves , unaccusauves , and obJect-drop verbs ( Levm , 1993 ) These are Interestmg classes because they all parUcapate m the trans~uvlty alternatmn , and they are minimal parrs that as , a small number of well-defined dmtmctmns d~fferentmte their trans , tlve/mtranmUve behavmr Thus , we expect the differences m their dmtnbuttons to be small , entailing a fine-grained dlscr , mmaUon task that prowdes a challenging testbed for automatic classfficatmn The specffic theoretical questmn we mvesUgate ~s whether the factors underlying the verb class dmtmctmns are reflected m the statmttcal dmtnbutmns of lex~cal features related to dmtheses presented by the md , v~dual verbs m the corpus In doing th~s , we address the questmns above by determining what are the lexmal features that could d~stmgmsh the behavtor of the classes of verbs w~th respect to the relevant dmtheses , ~hmh of those features can be gleaned from the corpus , and which of those , once the staUstmal dmtnbutmns are available , can be used successfully by an automatic classifier In m~ttal work ( Stevenson and Merlo , 1999 ) , ~e found that hngmstlcally motivated features that d~stmgmsh the verb classes can be extracted from an annotated , and m one case parsed , corpus These features are sufficient to almost halve the error rate compared to chance ( 45 % reductmn ) m automaUc verb classtficaUon , suggesting that d~stnbuUonal data prowdes knowledge useful to the class~ficaUon of verbs The focus of our original stud~ was tho demonstration m prmctple of l~a.nmg verb classes from frequency d~stnbutmns ofsyntactm features , and an analysm of the relaUve contrtbutmn of the various features to learmng Th~s paper turns to the nnportant next steps of rephcatmg our findrags using other training methods and learning algorithms , and analyzing the performance on each of tbe three classes of verbs This more detailed analys~s of accuracy within each class m turn leads to the development of a new dlstrtbutmnal feature mtended to improve dlscnmmabthty among t~o of the classes The addltmn of the ne~ feature successfully reduces the error rate of out mltml results m classlficatmn by 19 % , for a 56 % overall reductmn m error rate compared to chance In this sectmn , we present mouvatmn for the mttml features that we mvesUgated m terms of their role m

the subject and Theme to the optional object We expect the differing semantic role assignments of the verb classes to be reflected m their syntactic behavior , and consequently in the distributional data we collect from a corpus The three classes can be characterized by their occurrence in two alternations the transittve/mtrans~tive alternation and the causative alternation Unergatives are distinguished from the other classes m being rare in the transitive form ( see ( Stevenson and Merlo , 1997 ) for an explanation of this fact ) Both unergatives and unaccusatives are dlstmgmshed from obJect-drop m being causative in their transitive form , and sundarly we expect this to be reflected in amount of detectable causative use Furthermore , since the caus &amp; tlve is a transitive use , and the transitive use of unergatlves is expected to be rare , causativity should primarily distinguish unaccusatlves from objectdrops In conclusion , we expect the defining features of the verb classes -- the intransitive/transitive and causative ~lternatlons -- to lead to distributional differences m the observed usages of the verbs in these alternations 2 2 Psychollngmst~cally Relevant Features The verbs under study not only differ in their thematic properties , they also differ in their processmg properties Because these verbs can occur both in a trans~tive and an intransitive form , they have been particularly studied in the context of the mare verb/reduced relative ( MV/I : tR ) ambiguity illustrated below ( Bever , 1970 ) The horse raced past the barn fell The verb ~aced can be interpreted as either a past tense main verb , or as a past participle w~thm a reduced relative clause ( l e , the horse \ [ that was\ ] raced past the barn ) Because fell is the main verb , the leduced relative lnterpretatmn of raced is required for a coherent analysis of the complete sentence But the main verb interpretation of raced is so strongly preferred that people experience great difficulty at the verb fell , unable to integrate it with the interpretation that has been developed to that point However , the reduced relative interpretation is not difficult for all verbs , as in the follo~mg example The boy washed in the tub was angry The difference in ease of interpreting the lesolutions of this ambiguity has been shown to be sensitive to both frequency differentials ( MacDonald 1994 , Trueswell , 1996 ) and to verb class d~stmctmns ( Stevenson and Merlo , 1997 , Flhp et al , 1999 ) Consider the features that d~stmguish the t~o resolutions of the M\ , /RR ambiguity MV The horse raced past the barn quickly RR The horse raced past the barn fell In the main verb resolution , the ambiguous ~erb raced is used in its intransitive form , while in the reduced relative , it is used in its transitive , causative form These features correspond directly to the defining alternations of the three verb classes under study ( intransitive/transitive , causative ) ~ , ddltionally , we see that other related features to these usages serve to distinguish the two resolutions of the ambiguity The mare verb form Is active and a mare verb part-of-speech ( labeled as VBD by automatic POS taggers ) , by contrast , the reduced relative foim is passive and a past partic~ple ( tagged as \ BN ) Since these features ( active/passive and VBD/VBN ) are related to the intransitive/transitive alteination , we expect them to also exhibit d~stributloaal differences among the verb classes Specifically , ~e expect the unergatives to yield a higher proportion of act~ e and `` vBD usage , since , as noted above , the transitive use of unergatwes is rare Features We assume that currently available large cotpoLa are a reasonable approximation to language ( Pullum , 1996 ) Using a combined corpus of 65-mllhon words , we measured the relative frequenc ) distributions of the four linguistic features ( VBD/~ BN active/passive , Intransitive/transitive , causative/noncausative ) over a sample of verbs from the three lextcal semantic classes 3 1 Materials ~e chose a set of 20 verbs from each class based pllmaidy on the classfficatlon of verbs m ( Le~ m 1993 ) ( see Appendl~ ~ ) The uneigatlves ale maanei oI motion verbs The unaccusatl~es ale ~erbs of~haage of state The object-drop verbs are unspecified object alternation verbs The ~e~bs ~ere sele~Led flora Lenin 's classes based on their absolute fiequenc } Ful thermore , they do not generally sho~ ma~l~ e depaitures from the intended verb sense m the cotpu~ ( Though note that there are only 19 unaccu~atlxes because , zpped , ~hlch ~as initially counted m the unaccusatives , was then excluded from the aaal~sis as It occurred mostly in a different usage m the corpus , as a velb plus paltlcle ) Most of the vetb~ can occur m the transitive and in the passive Each ~erb presents the ~ame folm m the simple pa~t and m the past palticlple In order to smlphf~ the ~ouat17 mg procedure , we made the assumptron that counts on this single verb form would approximate the distribution of the features across all forms of the verb Most counts were performed on the tagged versron of the Brown Corpus and on the portion of the Wall Street Journal distmbuted by the ACL/DCI ( years 1987 , 1988 , 1989 ) , a combined corpus m excess of 65 mdhon words , with the exceptmn of causatrvlty which was counted only for the 1988 year of the WSJ , a corpus of 29 million words 3 2 Method We counted the occurrences of each verb token in a transrtlve or mt~ansltr~e use ( INTR ) , m an active or passive use ( ACT ) , rn a past pamcrple or smaple past use ( VBD ) , and in a causative or non-causative use ( CAUS ) More precrsely , features were counted as follows INTR a verb occurrence was counted as transrtlve if rmmediately followed by a nominal group , else rt was counted as mtransitrve ACT mare verbs ( tagged VBD ) were counted as actrve , participles ( tagged V BN ) counted as actrve ff the closest preceding auxiliary was have , as passive ff the closest preceding auxiliary was be VBD occurrences tagged VBD were simple past , VBN were past participle ( Each of the above three counts was normalized over all occurrences of the verb , yielding a single relative frequency measure for each verb for that feature ) CAUS The causative feature was approximated by the followmg steps Frrst , for each verb , all cooccurrmg subjects and objects were extracted from a parsed corpus ( Colhns , 1997 ) Then the proportmn of overlap between the two multrsets of nouns was calculated , meant to capture the causative alternation , ~here the subject of the mtransrtrve can occur as the object of the trans~trve Vve define overlap as the largest multiset of elements belongmg to both the subjects and the object multisets , eg { a , a , a , b } ( 3 { a } = { a , a , a } The proportron is the ratio between the o~erlap and the sum of the subject and object multrsets ( For example , for the rumple sets above , the ratio would be 3/5 or 60 ) All ra~ and normahzed corpus data ale a~adable from the authors , and more detarl concerning data collectron can be found m ( Stevenson and

				<sentence>Here is how this rule is represented in the # -TBL system 's compositional rule/template formalism : tag : vb &gt; nn &lt; tag : dr @ \ [ -1\ ] . This is of course the exact counterpart of the transformation rule in Brill 's original framework. Addition rules specify when a feature value should be added to a word. An example would be `` add tag nn to a word if the word immediately to the left has a tag tit '' : tag:0 &gt; nn &lt; tag : dr @ \ [ -1\ ] . Note that a feature value is actually added to a word only if it not already there. Deletion rules dictate when a feature value should be removed from a word. An example would be `` remove tag vb from a word if the word immediately to the left has a tag dt '' : tag : vb &gt; 0 &lt; tag : dt @ \ [ -1\ ] . Reduction rules reduce the set of feature values for a word with a certain value. An example would be `` reduce a word 's tag values with tag vb if the word immediately to the left has a tag dr '' : tag : vb &gt; l &lt; tag : dr @ I-I\ ] . An important difference between deletion rules and reduction rules is that the latter will only remove a feature value from a word if it is not the last value for that feature. If vb is the last value the above rule is not applicable and the reduction will not take place. This should remind us of the kind of constraints that are central to the so called reductionistic approach to disambiguation. as represented by for example Constraint Gram34 mar \ [ Karlsson et al. , 1995\ ] ) . Constraint grammars may indeed be possible to learn in the IL-TBL system , as I will show towards the end of this paper. In the p-TBL system 's rule formalism , conditions may refer to different symbol features , and complex conditions may be composed from simpler ones. For example , here is a rule saying `` replace the tag for adverb with the tag for adjective , if the current word is `` only '' , and if the previous tag , or the tag before that , is a determiner tag. '' : tag : ab &gt; jj &lt; wd : only @ \ [ O\ ] k tag : dt @ \ [ -1 , -2\ ] . Ill this paper , I will break with the tradition to think about transformation rules in exclusively procedural terms , and instead try to think about them in declarative and logical terms. Transformation rules ( partially ) describe an ordered sequence of pairs of symbols , which I will refer to as a relation. Such a relation form training data for a TBL system. Here is a simple ( and unrealistically small ) example : dt vb nn dt vb kn dt vb ab dt vb dt nn vb dt nn kn dt jj kn dt nn The sequence formed by the upper elements of the pairs will be referred to as Sl , and the sequence formed by the lower elements as Sn. Such sequences can be. modelled by means of two sets of clauses , which relate positions in the sequences to symbol feature values : $ 1 ( 1 , dr ) Sl ( 2 , vb ) $ 1 ( 3 , nn ) ... S1 ( 11 , vb ) S. ( I , dr ) S~ ( 2 , nn ) S. ( 3 , vb ) ... S. ( 11 , nn ) A central point in this paper is the suggestion that the declarative semantics of transformation rules can be captured by rule formulas in the form of universally quantified implications , and that , for example , the meanings of the four very simple rules shown previously are captured by the following formulas : Replacement Vpo , p , \ [ S , ( po , vb ) A ( Pl = 1 ) o 1 ) A St ( p , .dr ) -- r S , ( po , nn ) \ ] Addition Vpo , p , \ [ - , St ( po , nn ) A ( p , = Po 1 ) A St ( p , , at ) -- -r S , ( po , nn ) \ ] Deletion Vpo.p , \ [ St ( po , vb ) A ( p , = po 1 ) A St ( p , , dr ) -- ~ -~S. ( po , vb ) \ ] Reduction Vpo , p , \ [ Sl ( po , vb ) A Bxo\ [ S , ( po , xo ) A ( x0 # vb ) \ ] A ( P , = P0 -1 ) A S , ( pl , dt ) -- ~ -.S. ( po , vb ) \ ] Rule formulas as such will not be put to any direct computational use , but the notion of a rule formula provides a starting point , from which computational tools can be derived. A rule instance is a rule formula in which every variable has been replaced with a constant. Now , we may define the notions of positive and negative instances of rule formulas ( and thus indirectly of transformation rules ) . A positive rule instance is a rule instance where the mltecedent and the consequent are both true. Thus , the following formula is a positive instance of the formula corresponding to the simple replacement rule above : Sl ( 2 , vb ) A ( 1 = 2 1 ) A S , ( I , dt ) -- + S , ( 2 , nn ) A negative instance of a rule is a rule instance where the antecedent is true but where the consequent is false , for example : Sl ( 8 , vb ) A ( 7 = 8 1 ) A S~ ( 7 , dt ) -~ S , , ( 8 , nn ) Note that Brilrs notion of a neutral instance of a rule , i.e. an instance of a rule that replaces an incorrect tag with another incorrect tag , is a negative instance in my terminology. ( In practice , this does not seem to matter much , as I will show later. ) We now define two important rule evaluation measures. The score of a rule is the number of its positive instances minus the number of its negative instances : sco~e ( R ) =1 pos ( R ) 1 I neg ( R ) I The accuracy of a rule is its number of positive instances divided by the total number of instances of the rule : accuracy ( R ) = I pos ( R ) I I PยฐS ( R ) I + I neg ( R ) I The notion of rule accuracy is well-known in rule induction and inductive logic programming , and towards the end of this paper we will see that it may have a role to play in the context of transformation-based learning too. An Overview of the # -TBL System Through the use of unification and a particular search strategy ( backtracking ) , a logic programming environment such as Prolog implements a constructive kind of inference which allows us to define predicates that are able to recognize , generate and search for positive and negative instances of transformation rules. Furthermore , a layer of recta-logical predicates provides a way to collect and count such instances , and thus a way to calculate the score and accuracy for any rule. Therefore , in a logic programming framework , transformation-based learning can be implemented in a very clear and simple way. However , for such an implementation to become useful. we have to think about efficiency. Among other things , we need to think about how we index our training data. Assuming the part-of-speech tagging task. corpus data can be represented by '' means of three `` kinds of clauses : 35 wd ( P , N ) is true iff the word W is at position P in the corpus tag ( P , A ) is true iff the word at position P in the corpus is tagged A tag ( A , B , P ) is true iff the word at , P is tagged A and the correct tag for the word at P is B Although this representation may seem a bit redundant , it provides exactly the kind of indexing into the data that is needed. 3 A decent Prolog system can deal with millions of such clauses. Rules that can be learned in TBL are instances of templates , such as `` replace tag A with B if tho symbol ( e.g. the word ) immediately to the left has tag C , where A , B and C are variables. Here is how we write this template in the p-TBL system : t3 ( A , B , C ) # tag : A &gt; B &lt; tag : C @ \ [ -l\ ] . The term to the left of # is a unique identifier for the template. A template instance is a template in which every variable in the identifier has been replaced by a constant. If we strip the identifier we end up with a transformation rule again. The instantiated identifier uniquely identifies that rule. Positive instances of rules that are instancbs of the above template can be efficiently recognized , generated and searched for , by means of the following clause : positive ( t3 ( A , B , C ) ) : tag ( A , B , PO ) , Pl is PO-I , tag ( Pl , C ) . Negative instances are handled as follows : negative ( t3 ( A , B , C ) ) : tag ( A , X , PO ) , dif ( X , B ) , P1 is PO-I , taE ( PI , C ) . It should be clear how these clauses use the representation described above , and that they respect the semantics exemplified in the previous section. Clauses corresponding to other templates and other types of rules can be defined accordingly. Tied to each template is also an update proce.dure that will apply rules that are instances of this template , and thus update sequences , by replacing feature values with other feature values , adding to the feature values , or removing from them. For example : apply ( t3 ( A , B , C ) ) : ( tag ( A , X , P ) , P1 is P-l , tag ( PI , C ) , retract ( tag ( A , X , P ) ) , retract ( tag ( P , l ) ) , assert ( tag ( B , X , P ) ) , asser~ ( tag ( P , B ) ) , fail ; true ) . 3Assuming a Prolog with first argument indexing. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I To write clauses such as these by hand for large sets of templates would be tedious and prone to errors and omissions. Fortunately , since the formalism is compositional , it is easy to write a template compiler that generates them automatically. The # u-TBL system uses wellknown Prolog compiler writing techniques to expand templates written in the compositional high-level notation into clauses that can be run as programs. Thus , the convenience and flexibility of a high-level notation for templates and rules does not compromise performance. A template grammar defines the exact relation between a template and a set of clauses. As an illustration , the following grammar rules are used to expand a template into a Prolog clause defining positive/l , negative/1 and apply/l , for that template : term_expansion ( ( ID # A &lt; -Cs ) , \ [ ( positive ( ID ) : G1 ) , ( negative ( ID ) : G2 ) , ( apply ( ID ) : - ( G3.fail ; true ) ) \ ] ) : pos ( ( A &lt; -Cs ) , LI , \ [ \ ] ) , list2goal ( L1 .G1 ) , ne E ( ( A &lt; -Cs ) , L2 , \ [ \ ] ) . list2goal ( Li , G2 ) , app ( ( A &lt; -Cs ) , L3 , \ [ \ ] ) , list2goal ( L3 , G3 ) . pos ( ( F : A &gt; B &lt; -Cs ) ) -- &gt; { G = .</sentence>

				<sentence>Introduction Human face &lt; o-face communication is an ideal model for humm-computainterface. One of the major features of face-to-face communication is its multiplicity of communication channels that acts on multiple modalities. By providing a number of channels through which information may pass between a user and a computer , a multi-modal dialogue system gives the user a โข more convenient and natural interface than a language-only dialogue system. In the system , a user often uses a variety of anaphodc expressions like this , the red item , it , etc. User 's intention is passed to the system through multiple channels , e.g. , the auditory channel ( carrying speech ) and the visual channel ( c~nrying gestures and/or facial expressions ) . For example , a user can say utterance ( 4 ) in Figure ! ! while touching an item on the screen. The user may also say utterance ( 8 ) without touching the screen when there is only one red item displayed on the screen. Moreover , the user can use anaphoric expression to refer to an entity in previous utterances as in utterance ( 10 ) . ( 1 ) S : May I help you7 ( 2 ) U : I want to see some desks. ( 3 ) S : ( displaying mode/200 and mode/250 ) We have these modeb. ( 4 ) U : ( pointing to the model200 ) How much is thLv ? ( 5 ) S : It is 150,000 Won. ( 6 ) U : I 'd like to see some chairs , too. ( 7 ) S : ( displaying model 100 and model 150 ) We have t/w~re medeb. ( 8 ) U : How much is the red item ? ( 9 ) S : It is 80,000 Won. ( 10 ) U : ( pointing to the model 100 ) l 'd like to buy thb and tke prev/ous se/ect/on. Figure 1 : Motivational example I Previous rescaw , h on a multi-modal dialogue system was focused on finding the relationship between a pointing gesture and a deictic expression ( Bolt ( 1980 ) , Neal et al. ( 1988 ) , Salisbury et al. ( 1990. ) , Shimazu et al. ( 1994 ) , Shimazu and Takmhima ( 1996 ) ) and on mapping a predefined symbol to a simple t S means a multi-modal dialogue system and U means a user. Our goal is developing a multi-modal dialogue system ( Kim and Son ( 1997 ) ) . of which domain is home shopping and in which a user purchases furniture using Korean utC~ ' , mccs with pointing gestures on a touch screw. 21 command ( Johnston et al. ( 1997 ) ) . None of them , however , suggest methods of resolving deictic expressions with which pointing gestures are omitted : e.g.. the red item in utterance ( 8 ) . These approaches do not consider resolving an anaphoric expression that refers an object mentioned in previous utterances or displayed on previous screens. It , however , is important also for a multi-modal dialogue system to resolve all of these anaphora so that the system should correctly catch his/her intention. In this paper , we propose general methods to resolve a variety of anaphoric expressions that are found in a multi-modal dialogue. We classify anaphora into two types : deictic expression with/without a pointing gesture and referring expression , and propose methods to resolve them. To resolve deictic expression like this in utterance ( 4 ) which c~rs with a pointing gesture and the red item in utterance ( 8 ) which is uttered with no pointing gestures , the system counts the `` number of pointing gestures and the number of anaphoric noun phrases included in a user 's utterance , and compares them. Then , the system maps the noun phrases to pointed items. To resolve referring expression , one of the well known methods is centering theory developed by Grosz , Jo~hi , and Weinstein ( Grosz et al. ( 1983 ) ) . The centering algorithm was further developed by Brennan , Friedman and Pollard for pronoun resolution ( Brennan et al. ( 1987 ) ) and was improved by Walker ( Walker ( 1998 ) ) . However , ' those centering algorithms are not applicable to resolve anaphora in a multi-medal dialogue because the algurithm excludes the gestures and facial โข expression of a dialogue partner , which are important clues to mgierstand his/her uttexances. And. the algorithm can not resolve complex anaphora like the previous selection in ( 10 ) beeanse it does not keep the time When the previous screen is switched to the current screen. To resolve inch anaphom , we extend Walker 's centedng algorithm to the one with a dual cache model , which keeps the information displayed on a ~ With screen switching-time. The rest of this paper begins with describing our approach in section ! . After showing two methods to resolve anaphora in a rrmlti-modal dialogue system in section 2 , we report experimental results on these methods in section 22 In this paper , we define two types of anaphora : screen anaphora and referring anaphora. Screen anaphora is an anaphoric noun phrase that refers to an entity on the present screen by a pointing gesture or through a visual channel. For example , th/s in uuerance ( 4 ) in Figure ! is the screen anaphora referred by a pointing gesture , and the red item in utterance ( 8 ) is the one referred through a visual channel. Referring anaphora is an anaphoric noun phrase that refers to an entity in previous utterances or on pre~ , ions screens , For example , we call it in utterance ( 9 ) referring anaphora because the referred entity is the red item in the previous utterance ( 8 ) . We also call the previous selection in utterance ( 10 ) referring anaphora because the refe~nt is the model 200 shown on the previous screen. The screen anaphora resolution algorithm counts the number of pointing gestures and the number of anaphoric noun phrases included in the user 's utterance and compares them. If the numbers are equal , the system maps the gestures to the phrases. Otherwise. the system uses some heuristics to map the gestures according to the priority of the phrases. The referring anaphora resolution algorithm is based on the Walker 's centering algorithm with a cache model. Centering is formulated as a theory that relates focus of attention , choice of referring expressions and perceived coherence of utterances ; within a discourse segment. The centering algorithm ( Ccnsz et al. ( 1983 ) , Brennan et al. ( 1987 ) , Walker et aL ( 1990 ) ) consists of three main structures. Forwardlooking Centers are entities which form a set of entities associated with each. utterance. Forward-looking Centers are ranked according to their relative salience. The highest ranged entity is called the Preferred Center. Backwardlooking Center is a special member of this set. It is the highest ranked member of Forwardlooking Centers of the previous utterance , which is also realized in the current utterance. The algorithm defines a set of constraints , rules , and transition states between a pair of utterances by the use of these structures. It incorlgntes these rules and the other linguistic constraints to resolve anaphoric expressions. In the past , it was integrated with a stack model because most researchers believed that the centers should exist within a discourse segment ( Grosz and Sidner 0 0 0 0 O 0 0 0 0 O 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 O 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 O 0 0 0 0 O O ( 9 } NtS 80.000 WOn. { 8 } HOw much nt ff~ ' *~ steoO ( ~ ' ) We have s. , ~se moOel $ citer* , ttm feueeยข .. &gt; S'wffchit~l-fime Cache Memory Figure 2 : Walker 's cache model โข ~ m~ra~ sk~ ~maml slol lwmbll~ m~ m~t r , e~ m m~ JG~m~ Id~ ~a~ ~iw um~q W mb t~ .</sentence>

Sch0sler ( ed ) ( 1992 ) pp 11-12 and Braasch &amp; Pedersen ( forthcoming ) for some minor cons~derauons of regular polysemy m Danish nouns as well as Malmgren ( 1988 ) for an extensive study of iegular polysemy in Swedish , a language which displays polysemous behavlour very slmdar to Damsh ) Th~s fact underpins the need for corpus-oriented encoding procedures which have therefore been given a centlal focus m the the Danish SIMPLE d~ctlonary in the sense that each semantic encoding is supported by corpus exammauons 3 In the Damsh lexicon the most productive cases of regular polysemy mvolwng concrete nouns prove to be the following โข animal/food ot 44 mill runmng words ( consisting ot `` Bedmgske Korpus ' , 'Bergenholtz Korpus ' and 'Parole Korpus ' ) โข geographical location / human gloup โข fruit / plant โข human group / restitution โข semiotic artifact / reformation Other well-known polysemous palrs are not productive m Damsh , as for example 'people / language ' and 'flower / colour ' , where only a few examples of each can be found Thls difference relates to the d~stmct~on made by Apresjan ( apud Malmgren , 1988 ) between productive and iegular polysemy Here productwe polysemy refers to cases where more or less the whole group of nouns within a semantlc class display the same polysemy relations , whereas regular polysemy refers to cases where at least two words but not the whole class follow the same polysemy pattern Below xs shown an example of the semantic encoding of a proper noun denoting a Damsh c~ty , which belongs to the productwe 'geographlcal location / human group ' polysemy This example shows the encoding of the human group ' sense of the word This can be seen m the corpus example ( 'example ' ) , the defimtlon ( 'freedeflnmon ' ) , and the kinds of quaha roles encoded We beheve that the corpus-orlented approach used dunng the encoding of the Damsh SIMPLE lexicon facdltates the Ident~ficat~on of new polysemous classes ;

				<sentence>~ston corpus ( Ide and V6roms , 1994 ) , and the Bible ( Resnlk , et al , m press ) It is likely that these corpora do not provide enough appropriate data to reliably determine sense distinctions Also , ~t Is not clear how the lexlcahzatlon of sense distractions across languages Is affected by genre , domain , style , etc Thls paper attempts to provide some prehmlnary answers to the questions outhned above , In order to eventually determine the degree to which the use of parallel data ts vmble to determine sense distinctions , and , ff so , the ways in which th~s reformation might be used Given the lack of lalge parallel texts across multiple languages , the study is necessarily hmlted , however , close exammanon of a small sample of parallel data can , as a first step , provide the basis and dlrectmn for more extensive studies I have conducted a small study using parallel , aligned versmns ot George Orwell 's Nineteen Etghtv-Fo , lr ( Euavec and Ide , 1998 ) m five languages Enghsh , Slovene , Estonian , Romanlan , and Czech I The study therefole Involves languages from four language families The O~well parallel corpus also includes vers|ons o ) Ntneteen-E~gho Four m Hungarian , Bulgarmn , Latwan , Llthuaman , Se~bmn , and Russmn ( Germanic , Slavic , Fmno-Ugrec , and Romance ) , two languages from the same family ( Czech and Slovene ) , as well as one non-Indo-European language ( Estoman ) Nmeteen Eighty-Four Is a text of about 100,000 words , translated directly from the original English m each of the other languages The parallel versions of the text are sentence-aligned to the English and tagged for part of speech Although Nineteen Eighty-Four is a work of fiction , Orwell 's prose IS not highly stylized and , as such , it provides a reasonable sample ot modern , ordinary language that ~s not tied to a given topic or sub-domain ( such as newspapers , technical reports , etc ) Furthermore , the translations of the text seem to be relatively faithful to the original for instance , over 95 % ot the sentence alignments in the full pmallel corpus of seven languages are one-to-one ( Prlest-Dorman , et al , 1997 ) Nine ambiguous English words were considered hard , head , country , hne , promise , shght , seize , scrap , float The first four were chosen because they have been used in other dlsamb~guatlon studies , the latter five were chosen from among the words used m the Senseval dlsamblguatlon exercise ( Kllgamff and Palmer , forthcoming ) In all cases , the study was necessarily hmlted to words that occurred frequently enough in the Orwell text to warrant consideration F~ve hundred forty-two sentences conta|nmg an occurrence or occurrences ( Including morphological variants ) of each of the nine words were extracted from the Enghsh text , together w~th the parallel sentences m which they occur m the texts ot the four comparison languages ( Czech , Estonian , Romantan , Slovene ) As Walks and Stevenson ( 1998 ) have pointed out , pa~t-of-speech tagging accomplishes a good portion of the work ot semantic dlsamb~guatmn , therefore occmrences of wolds that appemed in the data in more than 54 one part of speech were grouped separately 2 The Enghsh occurrences were then grouped usmg the sense distinctions m WordNet , ( version 1 6 ) \ [ Miller et al , 1990 , Fellbaum , 1998\ ] ) The sense categonzatmn was performed by the author and two student assistants , results from the three were compared and a final , mutually agreeable set of sense assignments was estabhshed For each of the four comparison languages , the corpus of sense-grouped parallel sentences were sent to a llngmst and natl , ve speaker of the comparison language The hngmsts were asked to provide the lexlcal item m each parallel sentence that corresponds to the ambiguous Enghsh word If inflected , they were asked to provide both the inflected form and the root form In addttmn , the lmgmsts were asked to indicate the type of translatmn , according to the dtstmctmns given m Table 1 For over 85 % of the Enghsh word occurrences ( corresponding to types 1 and 2 m Table 1 ) , a specific lexlcal item or items could be identified as the translation equivalent for the corresponding Enghsh word For comparison purposes , each translanon equivalent was represented by ~ts lemma ( or the lemma of the toot form in the case of derivatives ) and associated w~th the WordNet sense to which it corresponds In order to determine the degree to which the assigned sense dlstlncttons correspond to translation eqmvalents , a coherence index ( Cl ) was computed that measures how often each pmr of senses is translated usmg the same word as well as the consistency with which a g~ven se , ls , z ~s translated with the same word ~ Note that the z The adJective and adverb senses of hard are consadeied together because the distinction is not consistent across the translations used m the study Note that the CI ~s similar to semanuc entropy ( Melamed , 1997 ) However , Melamed computes CIs do not determine whether or not a sense dtstmctton can be lextcahzed in the target language , but only the degree to whmh they are lexicahzed differently m the translated text However , tt can be assumed that the CIs provide a measure of the tendency to lex~cahze different WordNet senses differently , which can m turn be seen as an mdtcatmn of the degree to which the distraction ts vahd For each ambiguous word , the CI Is computed for each pair of senses , as follows S &lt; q t &gt; Cl ( sqS , ) = '=1 m rnrt where @ n ~s the number of comparison languages under consideration , nl~q and m , , are the nt~mber of occurrences olsense sqand sense s~ m the Enghsh corpus , respectively , including occurrences that have no

				<sentence>The French DELA system was conceived and developed at LADL ( Laboratoire d'Automatlque Documentaire et LmgmstIque ) It includes monohngual hngulstlc resources ( mainly for French and English ) specifically elaborated to be integrated into NLP systems Standard methods and formats-have been defined and are now used by other national teams working on their own languages German , Greek , Italian , Portuguese and Spanish Within that common framework , important fragments of the descnptmn of the languages involved have been worked out the syntactic and semantic properties of free and frozen sentences are descnbed and formalized e~s for the lexicon , a major component of NLP , large coverage electromc dlctionanes have been built Simple and compound words have been descnbed , and their hnguIstlc characteristics have been hand-coded by computational lexicographers using a common method Most of these lex~cal resources can now be imported into the Intex NLP system ~ , and then automatically applied to large texts Within the scope of this article , we describe the set of lexical resources built so far for Portuguese , and we gwe different examples of automatic Portuguese text parsing By electromc dictionary , we mean a computerized lexicon specifically elaborated to be used tn automatic text parsing operations ( indexing , recognition of complex words , technical and common , etc ) Thus , large coverage electronic dlctlonanes were built for Portuguese for that purpose The set of lexIcal data is organized according to the formal complexity of the lexlcal units The Portuguese DELAS IS the central element of the d~ctionary system Itcontains more than 110,000 simple words , whose grammatical attributes are systemaucally described and encoded The set of compound words Is structured m the Portuguese DELAC At the moment , it Is constituted by a lexicon of 22,000 compound nouns and 3,000 frozen adverbs , so it is stdl far from adequate completion 2 As said before , DELAS is the dIctmnary of simple words We understand by simple words the lexlcal units that correspond to a continuous string of i See http//www ladl lUSSleu fr/IN'I~X/mdex htm ll about 130,000 entries 74 letters The lexlcal entnes of DELAS have the followmg general structure &lt; word &gt; , &lt; formal description &gt; where word represents the canomcal form ( the lemma ) of a simple lexlcal umt ( m general the masculine smgular for the nouns and adjecuves , the mfinmve for the verbs ) , and formal description corresponds to an alphanumenc code contzanmg mformat~on on the grammatical attributes of the entries their grammatical class ( eventually , sub-class ) , and their morphological behavior The mflected forms are automaucally generated from the association of a lemma to an mflecuonal code the hst of all reflected words constitutes the Portuguese DELAF ( 1,250,000 word forms ) In Portuguese , the major grammatical classes nouns , adjectives and verbs have mflected forms -nouns and adjectives can appear m the femmme and/or m the plural , they can recewe dtmmuUve and augmentaave suffixes , the superlative degree of the adjectives can be expressed by morphological means ( suffixes ) , -verbs are conjugated ( mood , tense , person , number ) , furthermore , some verbal forms can undergo formal mo &amp; ficattons reduced by the presence of a clmc pronoun Thus , the DELAS entries gato , NOID1 gordo , AOIDIS1 ( where N and A mdtcate that gato ( cat ) ts a noun and gordo ( fat ) Is an adjective , 01 corresponds to the mflectlon rule for mascuhne , feminine , smgular and plural , DI and $ 1 exphclt the type of dtmmuttve and superlative suffixes that can be accepted by these entries ) produce the following infected forms ( DELAF entnes ) gato , gato N ms ( cat ) gata , gato N fs gatos , gato N mp gatas , gato N fp gatmho , gato N Dms ( httle cat ) gatmha , gato N Dfs gattnhos , gato N Dmp gatmhas , gato N Dfp gordo , gordo A ms ( fat ) gorda , gordo A fs gordos , gordo Amp gordas , gordo A fp 75 gordmho , gordo A Dins ( rather fat ) gordmha , gordo A Dfs gordmhos , gordo A Dmp gordmhas , gordo A Dfp gordlsslmo , gordo A Sms ( very fat ) gordfsstma , gordo A Sfs gordยฃsstmos , gordo A Stop gord\ [ sstmas , gordo A Sfp As for the verbs , for mstance , dar ( to gwe ) dar , VO2t gives rise to a hst of 73 reflected forms that correspond to the normal conjugation of a nondefective verb , in addmon , dar can be constructed with clmc pronouns ( t ) , m the posmon of accusative and dative complements So , m ( 1 ) Nds demos o hvro ~ Maria ( Lit We gave the book to Maria ) the verb form demos expresses mdlcatlve mood , past tense , and first person plural From a syntactic point of view , dar Is constructed with three arguments , subject Nds ( we ) and two complements o hvro ( the book ) , fi Maria ( to Maria ) The complement syntacuc posmons can be fulfilled by clmc pronouns , respecavely , o ( it ) , accusative , and lhe ( her ) , dauve , as m ( 2 ) N6s demo-lo ~ Maria ( Lit We gave tt to Maria ) ( 3 ) N6s demos-lhe o hvro ( Lit We gave her the book ) ( 4 ) Nds demos-lho ( Lit We gave her_t0 In ( 2 ) , the direct object has been chttclzed , and , due to historical phonetic reasons , both the accusative pronoun and the verb have undergone formal modifications o &gt; lo , demos &gt; demo In ( 4 ) , both pronouns ( dative and accusative ) are obhgatonly agglutinated , forming the contraction lho ( &lt; lhe + o ) So , even though the analysts of the combinations verb-chttc Is a syntactic matter , given the morphological changes reduced by such combinations m Portuguese , a first descnptlon had to be made at the morphcqegtcal level On the other hand , the example m ( 4 ) dlustrates a case where the formal notion of simple word does not correspond to an adequate hngutstlc analys~s Indeed , the form lho results from the contraction of two Independent oronouns lhe + o In Portuguese , contracted forms Issued from the agglutmatton of two different words ( and two different grammaucal categones ) are commonly observed We give some simple examples of contracuons resulting from the merging of preposmons with determiners , pronouns and adverbs pel ( o , a , os , as ) &lt; por + ( o , a , os , as ) ( by the ) del ( e , a , es , as ) &lt; de + ( ele , ela , eles , elas ) ( of ( him , her , them ) ) daqut &lt; de + aqut ( from here ) The relationship between contractions and their base constituent categories are estabhshed by finite-state transducers ( see below ) Compound words , l e , lexical units that are constituted by a fixed combination of s~mple words , represent a large amount of the lexicon of any language One has only to underline m a text the sequences of words that are frozen together to some extent to realize that compounds constitute an important percentage of the text 3 It is therefore illusory to envisage any sort of automatic processing before a slgmficant lexlcal coverage is achieved. The Issue is even more acute if one considers the description of sclenttfic or technical texts or any speciahzed lexicon , where the number of compounds can rise up to appalhng figures As said in 2 compounds are structured m the Portuguese DELAC Priority was given tO the hstlng and formahzatlon of compound nouns , that can mflect lua de mel luas de mel ( honeymoon ) , and to compound adverbs , that are invariable de repente ( suddenly ) From the point of view of the lexicon , the mare focus , especially as far as compound nouns are concerned , has been the every-day , not too techmcal , lexicon In order to ~dentlfy compound words , and dlstmgulsh them from formally Identical word free combinations , a set of morpho-syntactlc criteria was adopted ( Ranchhod ( 1991 ) , Bapttsta ( 1995 ) ) In short , compounds are the sequences of words that present restncUons to the See 5 ~Parsmg Texts Using INTEX Toolscombinatorial properttes that they were supposed to have The formallzauon of compound dtcuonary entries is slmdar to that of simple words Since compound adverbs , preposluons and conjunctions do not reflect , their formats are rather s~mple de repente , ADV+PC ( suddenly ) para corn , PREP ( towards ) afire de , CONJ ( m order to ) Compound nouns , however , have generally reflected forms The rules for the mflect~on of compound nouns presented by grammarians do apply to some cases , but most compound nouns exhibit mflecuonal restrictions on gender or number that can not be accounted by the morphological properties of their constituents In the DELA format , the inflectional properties of compound nouns are specified according to the same criteria as m the dictionary of simple words Thus , g~ven the following nominal entries of the DELAC ser ( 21 ) humano ( Ol ) , N + NA ms + ( human being ) guerra frta , N + NA fs ( cold war ) vtstta ( 30 ) de estudo , N + NDN fs + ( field trip ) The first two compound nouns , ser humano and guerra frta have an internal structure Noun Adjective ( NA ) , the most productwe class m Portuguese , vtstta de estudo ~s a compound of structure Noun de Noun , also a very productwe one Each entry is characterized by the posslbdlty ( + ) or lmposstbtllty ( - ) of gender and number reflection , respecttvely , the elements of the compound that can be inflected receive the mflecuonal code that they have m the DELAS both constltuents of ser humano inflect ( in number ) according to , respectively , the rules 21 and 01 ser humano seres humanos , guerra frta is invariable , and the noun vlstta de estudo only allows the inflection of vtstta vtstta de estudo vtsttas de estudo As well as for other languages ( e g French ) , addluonal mformat~on Is being added , namely semantic 76 Most of the local hngutstgc phenomena , as well as many complex sentences , are represented m a natural way by the formalism of finite-state automata ( FSA ) For instance , frozen or semtfrozen structures are very naturally described by graphs , that represent FSAs ( Sllberztem ( 1997 ) ) We illustrate the use of graphs with an elementary example , selected from the hbrarles of Portuguese local grammars This grammar descnbes a family of adverbial expressions ( dates ) , which refer to a period of ttme around the middle of the months ( or , by extensmn , of some years ) as m the underlined expression lsso aconteceu nos tdos de Marfo ( That happened on the ides of March ) \ / ? a l M~ , ' ~o , . / ~ , ok , ' , l , a. t , , ~ ) , ' , , , , , , , , , , @ N~ -- ' '' ~ ... . , : t~ , , , , , , , IO , ,z. , ,t ( , The following examples show how transducers are used to analyze contracuons , ambtgumes and compound numerical determiners As stated above ( 2 1 ) , contracted forms resulting from the agglutination of two independent words are commonly observed nn Portuguese To properly analyze these entrees we built flmte state transducers ( FST ) that , given a contracted form , produce an output corresponding to the decomposition of the contractxon into ~ts base constituents For xnstance , the FST ( de , ~ t~q~ , ,Al~ F~g 2 Analysis of the contracted form daqut decomposes daqut ( a contraction of the preposmon de ( from ) and the adverb aqut ( here ) ) m ~ts base constituents and , s~multaneously , associate to them the grammatical reformation of the dtcuonary ~__ / ~ ... ... ... .. \ [ : ~j '' \ [ Dtsambtguanon can be done at different moments โข ~ { i-~.'rld ... ... ... . ~ , ) , v , m , ! , of parsing '~ I..~. , .I ~ m ~ ' -- '~. , I'~ ' , '' ! / `` -~ , I '' '' '' I t a ) Dtsambtguatmn durmg normahzatwn - , ~lallll *J i : ~ ' ( I The normahzation of texts for hnguistlc analysis I~ \ [ uses FST to identify sentences and unambiguous โข It : | compounds , to solve contractions and ehsxons As i~ , ~ an example of dxsamblguatlon at this level , we โข I p.I , .i..

				<sentence>The mapping from WordNet to Hector senses m Senseval provides a `` gold standard '' against wluch to judge our ability to compare lexlcal resources The `` gold standard '' is provided through a word overlap analysis ( with and without a stop list ) for flus mapping , achieving at most a 36 percent correct mapping ( inflated by 9 percent from `` empty '' assignments ) An alternaUve componenttal analysis of the defimtaons , using syntacUc , collocatmnal , and semantac component and relation identification ( through the use ofdefimng patterns integrated seamlessly mto the parsing thclaonary ) , provides an almost 41 percent correct mapping , with an additaonal 4 percent by recogmzmg semantic components not used in the Senseval mapping Defimtion sets of the Senseval words from

~e The tecbauques described here consUtute only an maaal implementation of the componenUal analysis approach and suggests that considerable further improvements can be aclueved Introduction The difficulty of companng lemcal resources , long a s~gnfficant challenge in computauonal hnguistlcs ( Atlans , 1991 ) , came to the fore in the recent Senseval competatton ( IOlgarnff , 1998 ) , when some systems that relied heavily on the WordNet ( Miller , et al , 1990 ) sense inventory were faced with the necessity of using another sense inventory ( Hecto0 A hasty solutaon to the problem was the `` development of a map between the two inventories , but some part~cipants expressed concerns that use of flus map may have degraded their performance to an unknown degree Although there were disclaimers about the WordNet-Hector map , it nonetheless stands as a usable gold standard for efforts to compare lexical resources Moreover , we have a usable baseline ( a word overlap method suggested m ( Lesk , 1986 ) ) against which to compare whether we are able to make improvements m the mapping ( since flus method has been shown to perform not as well as expected ( Krovetz , 1992 ) ) We first describe the lextcal resources used m the study ( Hector , WordNet , other dicUonanes , and a lex~cal knowledge base ) , first characterizing them in terms ofpolysemy and the types of leracal mformaUon each contmns ( syntacUc properties and features , semantac components and relaUons , and collocaUonal properties ) We then present results of perfornung the word overlap analysis of the 18 verbs used m Senseval , analyzing the definitions m WordNet and Hector We then expand our analysis to include other dictionaries We describe our methods of analysis , particularly the methods of parsing defimtaons and identff ) qng semantic relations ( semrels ) based on defimng patterns , essentially takang first steps m Implementing the program described by Atkms and focusmg on the use of '' meamng '' full mformataon rather than statistical mformaUon We identify the results that have been achieved thus far and outline further steps that may add more `` meanmg '' to the analysis IAll analyses described m this paper were performed automatically using functlonahty incorporated m DIMAP ( Dictionary Maintenance Programs ) ( available for immediate download at ( CL Research , 1999a ) ) This includes automatac extracuon of WordNet reformation for the selected words ( mtegrated m DIMAP ) Hector defimtlons were uploaded into DIMAP dicUonanes after use of a conversmn program Defimtlons for other 30 The Lexical Resources Tlus analysis focuses on the mmn verb senses used In Senseval ( not ichoms and phrases ) , specifically the followmg AMAZE , BAND , BET , BOTHER , BURY , CALCULATE , CONSUME , DERIVE , FLOAT , HURDLE , INVADE , PROMISE , SACK , SANCTION , SCRAP , SEIZE , SHAKE , SLIGHT The Hector database used In Senseval consists of a tree of senses , each of which contains defimttons , syntactic properties , example usages , and `` clues '' ( collocational information about the syntactic and semantic enwronment in wluch a word appears in the spectfic sense ) The WordNet database contmns synonyms ( synsets ) , perhaps a defimtton or example usages ( gloss ) , some syntactic mformaUon ( verb frames ) , hypernyms , hyponyms , and some other semrels ( ENTAILS , CAUSES ) To extend our analysis In order to look at other issues of lexacal resource comparison , we have included the defirauons or leracal information from the following additional sources โข Webster 's 3

mappmg from WordNet 1 6 to Hector , using a s~mple word overlap analysis smular to ( Lesk , 1986 ) The lextcographer mapped the 66 WordNet senses ( each synset m which a test occurred ) Into 102 Hector senses A total of 86 assignments were made , 9 WordNet senses were gwen no assignments , 40 recewed exactly one , and 17 senses received 2 or 3 asssgnments The WordNet senses contained 348 words ( about half of wluch were common words appeanng on our stop list , which contained 165 words , mostly preposmons , pronouns , and conjunctions ) The Hector senses selected m the word overlap analysis contained about 960 words ( all Hector senses contained 1878 words ) We performed a strict word overlap analysts ( with and wsthout a stop hst ) between tile definlUons in WordNet and the Hector senses , that is , we did not attempt to ldenttfy root forms of Inflected words We took each word m a WordNet sense and determined whether ~t appeared in a Hector sense , we selected a Hector sense based on the highest percentage of words over all Hector senses An 31 empty selection was made ff all the words in the WordNet sense did not appear in any Hector sense , only content words were considered when the stop hst was used For example , for bet , WordNet sense 2 ( stake ( money ) on the outcome of an issue ) mapped into Hector sense 4 ( ( of a person ) to risk ( a sum of money or property ) m thts way ) In this case , there was an overlap on two words ( money , 039 in the Hector defimtlon ( 0 13 of its 15 words ) without the stop list When the stop list was invoked , there was an overlap of only one word ( money , 0 07 of the Hector defimtion ) In this case , the lexicographer had made three assignments ( Hector senses 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , our scoring method treated flus as only 1 out of 3 correct ( not using the relaxed method employed in Senseval of treating flus as completely correct ) Without the stop hst , our selections matched the lexicographer 's in 28 of 86 cases ( 32 6 % ) , using the stop list , we were successful in 31 of 86 cases ( 36 1 % ) The improvement arising when the stop list was used is deceptive , where 8 cases were due to empty assignments ( so that only 23 cases , 26 7 % , were due to matching content words ) Overall , only 41 content words were involved in these 23 successes when the stop list was used , an average of I 8 content words To summanze the word overlap analysis ( 1 ) despite a ncher set of defimtions in Hector , 9 of 66 WordNet senses ( 13 6 % ) could not be assigned , ( 2 ) despite the greater detail in Hector senses compared to WordNet senses ( 2 8 times as many words ) , only 1 8 content words participated in the assignments , and ( 3 ) therefore , the defimng vocabulary between these two definition sets seems to be somewhat divergent Although it might appear as if the word overlap analysis does not perform well , this is not the case The analysis provides a broad overview of the defimuon companson process between two definmon sets and frames a deeper analysis of the differences Moreover , it appears that the accuracy of a `` gold standard '' mapping is not crucially important The quality of the mapping may help frame the subsequent analysis more precisely , but it seems sufficient that any reasonable mapping will suffice This will be discussed further after presenting the results of the componentlal analysis of the defimtlons 32 Meaning-Full Analysis of Definitions The deeper analysis of the mapping between two defimtion sets relies primarily on two major steps ( 1 ) parsing definitions and using defimng patterns to identify semrels present m the definitions and ( 2 ) relaxing values to these relations by allowing `` synonymic '' substitution ( using WordNet ) Thus , for example , ffwe identify hypernyms or instruments from parsing a defimtion , we would say that the defimtions are `` equal '' not just ffthe hypernym or instrument is the same word , but also Lf the hypernyms or instruments are members of the same synset This approach is based on the finding ( Litkowski , 1978 ) that a dictionary induces a semantic network where nodes represent `` concepts '' that may be lexicahzed and verbalized in more than one way This finding implies , in general , the absence of true synonyms , and instead the kind of `` concept '' embodied in WordNet synsets ( with several lexical items and phraseologles ) A slmdar approach , parsing defimtlons and relaxing semrel values , was followed in ( Dolan , 1994 ) for clnstenng related senses w~thin a single dictionary The ideal toward which this approach strives is a complete identification of the meamng components included in a defimtion The meaning components can include syntactic features and charactenstlcs ( including subcategonzation patterns ) , semantm components ( realized through identification of semrels ) , selectional restrictions , and coUocational specifications The first stage of the analysis parses the definitions ( CL Research , 1999b , Litkowski , to appear ) and uses the parse results to extract ( via defining patterns ) semrels Since definitions have many idiosyncrasies ( that do not follow ordinary text ) , an important first step in this stage is preprocessmg the definition text to put it into a sentence frame that facilitates the extraction of semrels 2 2Note that the stop hst is not applicable to the definition parsing The parser is a full-scale sentence parser , where prepositmns and other words on the stop list are necessary for successful parsing Moreover , inclusion of the prepositions is cmcml to the method , since they are the bearers of much semrel information The extractmn of semrels examines the parse results , a e , a tree whose mtermedaate nodes represent non-ternunals and whose leaves represent the lextcal atems that compnse the defimuons , where any node may also include annotations such as characterizations of number and tense For all noun or verb defimttons , flus includes Identification of the head noun ( with recogmtton of '' empty '' heads ) or verb , for verbs , we signal whether the defimtaon contmned any selecttonal restnctmus ( that as , pamcular parenthesazed expressaons ) for the subject and object We then exanune preposattonal phrases In the defimUon and deterrmne whether we have a `` defining pattern '' for the preposaUon whach we can use as mdacaUve of a partacular semrel We also identify adverbs m the parse tree and look these up in WordNet to adentffy an adjecuve synset from wluch they are derived ( if one is gwen ) The defimng pattems are actually part of the dictionary used by the parser That is , we do not have to develop specafic routines to look for specLfic patterns A defimng pattern ~s a regular expressaon that arlaculates a syntactac pattern to be matched Thus , to recograze a `` manner '' semrel , we have the foUowmg entry for `` m '' m ( dpat ( ( ~ rep0 l ( det ( 0 ) ) adj manner ( 0 ) st ( manner ) ) ) ) This allows us to recognize `` m '' as possibly gwmg rise to a `` manner '' component , where we recogmze `` m '' ( the tdde , which allows us to specify partacular elements before the `` m '' as well ) , vath a noun phrase that consasts of 0 or 1 determiner , an adjectwe , and the lateral `` manner '' The '0 ยฐ after the detenmner and the hteral mdacate that these words are not copied into the value for a `` manner '' role , so that the value to the `` manner '' semrel becomes only the adjectwe that as recogmzed The second stage of the analysis uses the populated lexacal database to compare senses and make the selectaons This process follows the general methodology used m Senseval ( Lltkowska , to appear ) Specifically , m the defimtaon comparison , we first exanune exclusaon cntena to rule out specific mappings These criteria include syntacUc properUes ( e g , a verb sense that Is only transluve can not map into one that Is only mtransRave ) and collocataonal propertaes ( e g , a sense that is used with a parUcle can not map into one that uses a different particle ) At the present tune , these are used only rmmmally 33 We next score each viable sense based on rots semrels We increment the score ff the senses have a common hypernym or If a sense 's hypernyms belong โข to the same synset as the other sense 's hypernyms If a parUcular sense con~ns a large number of synonyms ( that as , no differentiae on the hypernym ) and they overlap consaderably m the synsets they evoke , the score can be increased substanUally Currently , we add 5 points for each match 3 We increment the score based on common semrels In tins amtml tmplementaUon , we have defimng patterns ( usually qmte nummal ) for recogmzmg Instrument , means , location , purpose , source , manner , has-constituents , has-members , is-part-of , locale , and goal 4 We Increment the score by 2 points when we have a common semrel and then by another 5 points when the value Is ~dentacal or m the same synset After all possable increments to the scores have been made , we then select the sense ( s ) w~th the lughest score Finally , we compare our selecuon with that of the gold standard to assess our mapping over all senses Another way an wluch our methodology follows the Senseval process as that at proceeds incrementally Thus , ~t ms not necessary to have a `` final '' perfect parse and mapping rouUne We can make conUnual refinements at any stage of the process and exarmne the overall effect As m Senseval , we may make changes to deal wath a particular phenomenon with the result that overall performance dechnes , but w~th a sounder basis for making subsequent amprovements Results of Componential Analysis The `` gold standard '' analysis Involves mapping 66 WordNet senses with 348 words into 102 Hector senses with 1878 words Using the method described above , we obtained 35 out of 86 correct 3At the present tame , we use WordNet to adentffy semreis We envaslon usmg the full semanlac network created by parsing all a dlcUonary 's defimtaons Thas would include a richer set of semrels than currently included m WordNet 4The defimng patterns are developed by hand We have onlyJust begun this effort , so the current set ms somewhat Impoverished mappmgs ( 407 % ) , a shght improvement over the 31 correct assignments usmg the stop-last word overlap techmque However , as mentioned above , the stophst techmque had aclueved 8 of its successes by matclung null assignments Consadered on tlus basins , ~t seems that the componentaal analysis techmque provides substantial ~mprovement In addition , our technique `` erred '' on 4 cases by malang assagnments where none were made by the leracographer We suggest that these cases do con~n some common elements of meaning and may conceivably not be construed as errors The mapping from WordNet to Hector had relatavely few empty mappings , senses for wtuch It was not possable to make an assignment These are the cases where at appears that the chetmnanes do not overlap and thus prowde a tentative mdacataon of where two dictionaries may have different coverage The cases of multiple assignments mchcate the degree ofamblgmty m the mapping The average m both darecUons between Hector and WordNet were donunated by the mabdaty to obtain good dascnnunatton for the word `` semze '' Thus , tlus method identifies individual words where the &amp; scnnunatwe ablhty needs to be further refined โข Perhaps more importantly , the componentml analysis method exploits consaderably more WordNet Hector โข mformauon than the word overlap methods Whereas the stop-hst word overlap mapping was โข based on only 41 content words , the componenual ~ approach ( In the selected mappings ) had 228 hits in ~ .</sentence>
