				<sentence>Z ) B~TY • ~'-• z ~ PN Conj Japan/IBM and PN &lt; TM Sum~tomo Electric The conjunction ~ ( `` to '' ) binds the two entities IBM Japan and Sumitomo Electric as co-subjects. Alternately this paradigm altows for modifiers before either or both of the entities ( ExcIptes 3 -S ) : ( Ex.3 ) I , ~ ~ ~l~I~I Toyota and US car.~ ~ ~b -GM ( ~t maker GM &lt; TM ( Ex.4 ) B ~ 8 | , bI , ,Y , ~ Japanese carmaker Toyota and GM &lt; TM ( Ex.S ) Japanese carmaker Toyota and US carmaker GM &lt; T~ Thus far , the prototypical Impact Line can be encapsulated in the following short notation : ... .. X where X is a principat tie-up entity and the ellipsis marks allow inclusion of multiple subjects as shown in Examptes 2 -5. It is important to note , moreover , that whether modifiers precede an ENTITYdesignate or not , or whether a conjunction is present or not , the topic marker =wo~ is preceded immediately -in the grammatical sense -by an entity that is a principal t~e-up partner. Twentyone of the 117 `` wo '' -designated entities are preceded immediately by information about the entity -such as location -enclosed ~n parentheses , rather than the entity name ~tself. For exampte : Nikko Securities ( hqs. Tokyo ) &lt; TM Orthographically this may be misleading , but grammatically the topic marker indicates the entity , not its headquarters location. Therefore , such cases retain their prototypical validity. ( 2 ) IMPACT LINE TOPIC MARKER ( PRACTICAL FORCE ) The Impact Line topic marker exerts a force that extends beyond the scope of a JJV article 's first sentence. In instances of ellipsis , which occurs frequently throughout the JJV corpus , the appropriate subject can be supplied by inserting the Impact Line `` wa '' -designated subject. Articte # 1747 is a classic example of Japanese presentation : |~t~'~ : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ... . ~. ~ ) ~~ Literat transtation ( \ [ \ ] indicates zero anaphora ) :1 ) On the 6th Joyo Bank announced 168 that \ [ \ ] hod concluded o comprehensive business tie-up with Nomuro Securities. Z ) In the securities area , \ [ \ ] already has o tie-up arrangement with Nikko Securities , but in order to meet the diverse needs of \ [ \ ] regional customers , \ [ \ ] is making up for the lock of securities-related services through tie-ups with several companies ... . 4 ) As far as the tieup with Nomura is concerned , M &amp; A ( company mergers and acquisitions ) business is included , and Joyo is poised to move aggressively into this area. Note that the Impact Line subject , Joyo Bank , does not appear again until the fourth sentence , which is the last line of the article. Until it reappears as the subject , it is omitted and one needs to supply a pronoun or proper name -~it '' , `` its `` , `` Joyo '' -in order to read the passage understandabty in English. In other words , the heuristic , which states that e11ipsis can be filled by the subject marked by the Impact Line topic marker , works quite wet1 here. Admittedly this is an easy case because stylistically Japanese allows ellipsis in a sentence that follows one in which the subject was introduced originally. In fact , using the term heuristic qua a convention with grammatical and stylistic acceptability may be inappropriate. However , in numerous other instances when convenience dominates and ellipsis is propagated throughout a text beyond the decent bounds of style , assigning the proper subject is less clear-cut. Particularly troublesome are those cases in which ellipsis continues for several sentences before the introduction of a new subject appropriately designated by another topic marker. Thereafter , the subject -which one ? -is again omitted , and one must decide between calling upon the proximate `` wa Ydesignated subject or the original Impact Line `` wa '' -designated agent. When coding or checking 1 @ @ of the 15 @ test-set articles , I noted only one instance ( # 2111 ) in which context demanded that the subject of a particularly complex sentence was not the default Impact Line Uwa mdesignated one. It is , therefore , a powerful heuristic , especially in the JJV corpus where the articles ore on overage short and the ~protogonist '' principal tie-up entity is highlighted at the outset by the Impact Line `` wa. ~ The protagonist entity usually announces the tie-up to the public , and in this sense , ~has the action ~ throughout the remainder of the text. In short , when in doubt one should revert to the initial topic subject. INVALID USES OF uWA '' Before turning to the Impact Line verbal element and finishing the prototype version-1 definition , the two types of occurrences below help illustrate further the legitimate uses of ~wo '' by showing what does not qualify as prototypical : three instances in which the Impact Line topic marker is not preceded by an ENTITY but by a PERSON who is announcing a tie-up. The entity name is present as a modifier , e.g. , Japan Development Bank 's Takahashi Hajime president &lt; '\ [ 14 Such instances ore eliminated from consideration as a prototype because the initial `` wo ~ is not preceded by a principal tie-up partner. 169 marks a valid entity for extraction , however , it is not o principal tieup partner ; it is the PARENT of one of the principals. ( 3 ) IMPACT LINE : OTHER : REQUISITE ELEMENTS As mentioned above under GRAMMATICAL FORCE , the JV application tracks tie-up relationships between two or more entities. And , it has already been demonstrated that the Impact Line topic marker is a reliable indicator ( 81 % of the JJV test set ) of at least one of those entities. The next question is : Does the prototypical Impact Line also contain the other elements required for instantiating a tie-up ? That is : I ) Is the name of the other tieup entity ( ties ) present in the Impact Line , and 2 ) is there any explicit indication that the arrangement between the two entities is in fact a tie-up relationship ? i ) Remarkably , there are only seven instances -over and above the previously cited 117 -in which an Impact Line would otherwise be considered prototypical except that the other tie-up partner name ( s ) is not specified until later in the text. In other words , 81 % of JJV test-set Impact Lines indicate clearly not only by virtue of the topic marker at least one tie-up entity , but atso introduce the name of the other principal partner as well. 2 ) In order to confirm that any two or more entities present in the Impact Line are in a tie-up relationship , the Impact Line must state specifically that this is the case. The verbal elements at the end of the Impact Line are important to look at , therefore , in determining whether there is a tie-up or not. Typically , Japanese text will stipulate ~teikei , '' which is the most frequent term for tie-up , but will also use other phrases that are either synonymous or describe an arrangement or activity that presupposes a tie-up , such as : ( agreed to join ) ( z ~ED C , 7a ( signed contract to establish JV company ) ( announced the formalization of an R &amp; D contract ) A11 of the previously judged 117 prototypical instance meet this standard , and not surprisingly , given the formulistic nature of the Impact Line , 96 out of those 117 ( 82 % ) employ the word ~teikei. '' ( Example 7 later discusses an Impact Line in which `` teikei ~ does not appear. ) ( 4 ) VERSION-1 REVIEW Example 1 : PN-Subject &lt; llW Numeral+N Tokyo Marine &amp; Fire 17th &lt; ~ ' , J~ ~ X~-~.~ ( ~ N Prt NP English big/wen ' 1/insur N PN camp. Commercial Union N N PN Prt camp. hqs. London with 170 VP Prt VP business/tie-up/did announcem't/did Example I is reprised above to review the elements of a prototypical Impact Line. It must contain all the elements required by a valid tie-up. Therefore , the Impact line must state that there is a tie-up ( or , was , in the case of dissolution ) between at least two entities who are named ; more if the partnership so stipulates. 4 Furthermore , at least one of the named tie-up entities -the `` protagonist '' -must be followed immediately by the topic marker Version-1 Criteria : • Two Entities : Tokyo Marine &amp; Fire and Commercial Union • `` Wa-Designated Protagonist Tie-Up Entity : Tokyo Marine &amp; Fire • Existence of Tie-Up Relationship : indicated by keyword ~i~ `` teikei '' At first glance this seems like an onerous burden for a prototypical structure to bear. But it is the discourse nature of Impact Lines in the 3JV domain to be replete with pertinent information , much of it suitable for extraction. In view of the fact that the Impact Line introduces much data at the outset of an article , a more restrictive definition ( version 2 ) requiring the Impact Line to contain additional extractable data items is presented below. DEFINITION OF PROTOTYPICAL IMPACT LINE ( VERSION Z ) The definition of version 2 requires the presence of two extractable data items in the Impact Line in addition to the minimum criteria of version 1 above shows , a valid tie-up relationship exists between Tokyo Marine &amp; Fire and Commercial Union. Moreover , the statement presents two additional pieces of information that are relevant for extraction : Commercial Union is an English company ( NATIONALITY ) and its headquarters is in London ( ENTITY LOCATION ) . One is also told that Commercial Union is , indeed , a company ( ENTITY TYPE ) , but this is considered less an item that is extracted discretely than one that follows automatically from the identification of the entity itself. This slot will be discussed later as a =default ~ fill. The types of extractable data items that occur in the 117 prototypical Impact Lines are listed , with the SLOT NAME followed by instances of occurrence enclosed in parentheses : ENTITY LOCATION ( 79 ) * , INDUSTRY TYPE ( 88 ) , PRODUCT/SERVICE ( 88 ) , NATIONALITY ( 56 ) * , PERSON NAME ( 44 ) * , PERSON POSITION ( 40 ) * , PERSON ENTITY AFFILIATION ( 44 ) * , ALIAS ( 25 ) , START TIME ( 12 ) , END TIME ( I ) , CHILD COMPANY ( II ) , ECONOMIC ACTIVITY SITE ( 9 ) , INVESTMENT ( 1 ) , FACILITY NAME ( i ) , FACILITY LOCATION ( I ) , and JV COMPANY ( i ) . The *-marked slots indicate that when these particular data items appear in a 33V test-set article , they ore more opt to appear in the Impact Line than in the remainder of the text. For example , ENTITY LOCATION information occurs in the Impact Line in 79 cases out of a total of 118 instantiations in the JJV test set , or 67 % for the JJV test corpus ; the percentages for PERSON NAME , PERSON ENTITY AFFILIATION , PERSON POSITION , AND NATIONALITY ore 59 % , 53 % , 53 % , and 44 % respectively. There ore , 171 moreover , orthographic consistencies in the textual presentation of certain information that should be noted : A11 but three of the 79 ENTITY LOCATION items are enctosed in parens ; o11 but six for the ALIAS ; and o11 of the PERSON NAME , POSITION , ENTITY AFFILIATION data. Viewed another way , out of 117 version-I prototypical Impact Lines , eight hove no additional data items ; 15 have just one ; 27 hove two ; 19 hove three ; 17 hove four ; and 31 Impact Lines have five or more data items. In other words , if the version-2 definition of o prototypicot Impact Line were to require the presence of two additional data elements , such as NATIONALITY and ENTITY LOCATION as in the case of Example I above , then there ore 94 ( 117 minus the 23 that hove less than two additional items ) instances out of the 145 33V test corpus that quotify , or 65 % of the \ ] \ ] V test corpus. Viewed from either version of the Impact Line prototype , articles in the 33V test corpus possess at the outset a wealth of potential information for the extraction task -81 % in its most lenient interpretation and 65 % in its more restrictive. Two Impact Line examples from the JJV test corpus ore given below to highlight the requirements of the version-2 definition of the Impact Line prototype : Exampte 6 : B ~z~ @ ~ ~ ~B~ PNSubj &lt; ll4 N+Prt ( Ad j ) Hitachi/manuf./ptoce American ~t~ -~ NP large/computer/maker =~b~ F ./~F~ ( HP ) PN Hewlett Packard Co.

One needs to discuss first , however , the notion of template `` default '' fills. Default fills can be classified as either de jure , de facto , or logical. De jure defaults include the top-level or TEMPLATE OBJECT fills , such as the DOC-NR , DOC-DATE and DOC-SOURCE , whose slots ore filled by SGML-togged data items. They ore , what one might call , `` gimmes '' by design and , therefore , are not incorporated in the scoring algorithm that measures system performance. The de facto and logical defaults need some explanation. De facto defaults correspond to those set fills instantiated with a very high percentage of one type of data. Judging by actual systems ' output and the patterns of certain answer-key template fills , no one will dispute that , in the end , data fetl out of text into some set fills at a much higher frequency than was intuited originottywhen the template was being designed , s Below is o snapshot of highpercentage 33V test-set set fills. ( The second figure represents percentages for 100 randomly selected development-set articles. ) design time over the course of pr ( x~essing approximately 50 articles became blurred unavoidably as the fill rules evolved. Therefore , the initial random distribution between , e.g. , the ENTITY TYPE set fills of COMPANY , GOVERNMENT , INDIVIDUAL , and OTHER became lopsided in favor of COMPANY. 173 SLOT NAME FILL TESTDEV-SET % SET % TIE-UP STATUS ENTITY TYPE REL'ENT2-TOEl ENT REL STATUS EXISTING 95 % 91.50 % COMPANY 98.30 % 96.60 % PARTNER 82.60 % 84.50 % CURRENT 94.50 % 95.50 % Given these percentages , how did the systems actually perform ? Is there any indication that these de facto default fills were instantiated ? The figures below seem to offer evidence for this. Every system evaluated on the TIPSTER JJV test corpus for MUC-S showed substantially lower error rates for each of the above set fills versus their overall ( A11-Objects ) error scores. SYSTIEENTIRELER OVERTEM UP TY 2-TOSTATALL STATTYPE i US ERROR US I 28 28 35 33 54 2 47 42 51 49 72 3 40 37 46 45 63 4 47 48 45 45 70 S 56 46 53 51 70 6 25 26 35 31 S @ The descriptive analysis of the 12 templates mentioned above in METHODOLOGY shows a similarly distinctive trend in actuaI systems ' output. The 12 templates were not randomly selected : All of them meet the version-1 definition for the Impact Line prototype , and only four do not meet the restrictive one ; six articles are short -six lines or less in length ; one article specifies three principal tie-up partners in the Impact Line rather than the usual two ; two articles contain multiple tie-ups rather than the usual ( 84 % of JJV test corpus ) one tie-up ; one article specifically mentions the formation of a 3V company in the Impact Line ; two Impact Lines introduce a principal tie-up entity marked by the topic marker `` wa '' that is clausally modified by the name of its parent company ; and one article 's Impact Line marks two tie-up entities. In short , whenever a correct ENTITY was instantiated by any system , the above-mentioned default fills cascaded throughout the template , even if -practically speaking -the resulting fills indicated that a lone COMPANY was in o CURRENT PARTNER relationship with itself. The discussion of article 1528 below shows such an instance of this. Other template fills con be regarded as logical defaults , or those that ore o logical consequence of the template object-oriented design. If the keyword ~teikei '' confirms that there is a tie-up and its status is , as mentioned above EXISTING , then obviously the template has o tie-up event ; i.e. , a TIE-UP OBJECT must be instantiated to accommodate the extraction of such information as TIE-UP STATUS , ENTITY , etc. Similarly , if there is a tie-up event and two entities are in a relationship defined as PARTNER , then obviously there is an ENTITY RELATIONSHIP. If there is an INDUSTRY TYPE identified , there must be on ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OBJECT to accommodate the INDUSTRY OBJECT , which in turn accommodates the INDUSTRY TYPE. The template structure and other logical effects for inserting extracted data items into it will be outlined further below in the discussion of # 1528. 174 , t , THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF PROTOTYPICAL DISCOURSE AND THE DEFAULT MECHANISM To i11ustrate the potential effects that stereotypical 33V discourse structure has on template fills and overall performance when the de facto defaults are considered as wet1 , the example of article # 1528 is submitted betow. % 528 Impact L~ne : PN &lt; TM PN Shi seido ophthatmi c/phorm./co.

( remainder omitted ) Number 1528 is a short six-line article with o version-2 prototypical Impact Line containing the following data items : • Existence of Tie-up Relationship : indicated by keyword `` teikei '' • =Protagonist '' Tie-up Partner indicated by topic marker `` wa '' : Shiseido • Tie-up Partner : Senju Pharmaceutical • Entity Location ( specificotly named ) : Osaka • Person Name : Shoji Yoshido • Person Position : President • Entity Affiliation ( info foltows entity it describes ) : Senju • Tie-up Partner : Maruho • Entity Location ( inferred from `` dittoS ) : Osaka • Person Name : Hide , Ycmw~moto • Person Position : ( unclear whether `` ditto ~ indicates president ) • Entity Affiliation : Moruho • Industry Type : Soles • Product/Service String : =medical supplies ~ Data items from remainder of text : • Alternate Product/Service String for Sales • Another Industry Type : Production • Product/Service String for Production • Alternate Product/Service String for Production • Economic Activity Agents : Shiseido , Senju , Maruho • Start Time for Production • Revenue for Soles • Start Time for Revenue • Revenue Type • Revenue Rate Adding the logicat and de facto default stats -such as TIE-UP , TIE-UP STATUS , ENTITY TYPE , ENTITY RELATIONSHIP , REL-ENTZ-TO-ENTi , 175 ENTITY RELATIONSHIP STATUS , ECONOMIC ACTIVITY , etc. , there are a total of 47 possible fills that are scored. SYSTEM I : MINIMUM CASE SCENARIO Given the plethora of data items in the Impact Line and its prototypical structure , minimally o system should be able to identify and extract on ENTITY NAME ( Shiseido ) by the topic marker =wo '' because this element of the Impact Line is the most consistent port of the prototype. Suppose , moreover , o system confirms the existence of a tie-up event ( CONTENT ) by identifying the keyword =teikei , ~ which is another consistent element of the Impact line prototype , and one other data item from the Impact Line such as the INDUSTRY TYPE SALES , which also has a keyword associated with it `` hanbai. '' This system would have in effect identified and extracted three data items from the Impact Line. The default instantiations associated with the extraction of these items would be : TIE-UP STATUS ( EXISTING ) , the named ENTITY ( is a constituent of the TIE-UP ) , ENTITY TYPE ( COMPANY ) , on ENTITY RELATIONSHIP , the named ENTITY ( is a constituent of the ER ) , an ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ( accommodates INDUSTRY ) , INDUSTRY ( accommodates INDUSTRY TYPE ) , REL-ENTZ-TO-ENTI ( PARTNER ) , and ENTITY RELATIONSHIP STATUS ( CURRENT ) , for a total of 12 template fills. This can also be viewed below schematically in template fashion. ( The bold lettering indicates the three data items extracted from the Impact Line to highlight their place of insertion into the template and the embedding described above ; italicized print indicates de facto default fills ; plain text designates logical defaults ; the &lt; TEMPLATE OBJECT &gt; de jure default fills are not scored except for CONTENT ; and the numbers ( I ) ( 12 ) represent the total correct fills . )</sentence>

The verbal elements at the end of the Impact Line are important to look at , therefore , in determining whether there is a tie-up or not. Typically , Japanese text will stipulate ~teikei , '' which is the most frequent term for tie-up , but will also use other phrases that are either synonymous or describe an arrangement or activity that presupposes a tie-up , such as : ( agreed to join ) ( z ~ED C , 7a ( signed contract to establish JV company ) ( announced the formalization of an R &amp; D contract ) A11 of the previously judged 117 prototypical instance meet this standard , and not surprisingly , given the formulistic nature of the Impact Line , 96 out of those 117 ( 82 % ) employ the word ~teikei. '' ( Example 7 later discusses an Impact Line in which `` teikei ~ does not appear. ) ( 4 ) VERSION-1 REVIEW Example 1 : PN-Subject &lt; llW Numeral+N Tokyo Marine &amp; Fire 17th &lt; ~ ' , J~ ~ X~-~.~ ( ~ N Prt NP English big/wen ' 1/insur N PN camp. Commercial Union N N PN Prt camp. hqs. London with 170 VP Prt VP business/tie-up/did announcem't/did Example I is reprised above to review the elements of a prototypical Impact Line. It must contain all the elements required by a valid tie-up. Therefore , the Impact line must state that there is a tie-up ( or , was , in the case of dissolution ) between at least two entities who are named ; more if the partnership so stipulates. 4 Furthermore , at least one of the named tie-up entities -the `` protagonist '' -must be followed immediately by the topic marker Version-1 Criteria : • Two Entities : Tokyo Marine &amp; Fire and Commercial Union • `` Wa-Designated Protagonist Tie-Up Entity : Tokyo Marine &amp; Fire • Existence of Tie-Up Relationship : indicated by keyword ~i~ `` teikei '' At first glance this seems like an onerous burden for a prototypical structure to bear. But it is the discourse nature of Impact Lines in the 3JV domain to be replete with pertinent information , much of it suitable for extraction. In view of the fact that the Impact Line introduces much data at the outset of an article , a more restrictive definition ( version 2 ) requiring the Impact Line to contain additional extractable data items is presented below. DEFINITION OF PROTOTYPICAL IMPACT LINE ( VERSION Z ) The definition of version 2 requires the presence of two extractable data items in the Impact Line in addition to the minimum criteria of version 1 above shows , a valid tie-up relationship exists between Tokyo Marine &amp; Fire and Commercial Union. Moreover , the statement presents two additional pieces of information that are relevant for extraction : Commercial Union is an English company ( NATIONALITY ) and its headquarters is in London ( ENTITY LOCATION ) . One is also told that Commercial Union is , indeed , a company ( ENTITY TYPE ) , but this is considered less an item that is extracted discretely than one that follows automatically from the identification of the entity itself. This slot will be discussed later as a =default ~ fill. The types of extractable data items that occur in the 117 prototypical Impact Lines are listed , with the SLOT NAME followed by instances of occurrence enclosed in parentheses : ENTITY LOCATION ( 79 ) * , INDUSTRY TYPE ( 88 ) , PRODUCT/SERVICE ( 88 ) , NATIONALITY ( 56 ) * , PERSON NAME ( 44 ) * , PERSON POSITION ( 40 ) * , PERSON ENTITY AFFILIATION ( 44 ) * , ALIAS ( 25 )</definiens>
				<definiens id="3">The *-marked slots indicate that when these particular data items appear in a 33V test-set article , they ore more opt to appear in the Impact Line than in the remainder of the text. For example , ENTITY LOCATION information occurs in the Impact Line in 79 cases out of a total of 118 instantiations in the JJV test set , or 67 % for the JJV test corpus ; the percentages for PERSON NAME , PERSON ENTITY AFFILIATION , PERSON POSITION , AND NATIONALITY ore 59 % , 53 % , 53 % , and 44 % respectively. There ore , 171 moreover , orthographic consistencies in the textual presentation of certain information that should be noted : A11 but three of the 79 ENTITY LOCATION items are enctosed in parens ; o11 but six for the ALIAS ; and o11 of the PERSON NAME , POSITION , ENTITY AFFILIATION data. Viewed another way , out of 117 version-I prototypical Impact Lines , eight hove no additional data items</definiens>
				<definiens id="4">five or more data items. In other words , if the version-2 definition of o prototypicot Impact Line were to require the presence of two additional data elements , such as NATIONALITY and ENTITY LOCATION as in the case of Example I above , then there ore 94 ( 117 minus the 23 that hove less than two additional items ) instances out of the 145 33V test corpus that quotify , or 65 % of the \ ] \ ] V test corpus. Viewed from either version of the Impact Line prototype , articles in the 33V test corpus possess at the outset a wealth of potential information for the extraction task -81 % in its most lenient interpretation and 65 % in its more restrictive. Two Impact Line examples from the JJV test corpus ore given below to highlight the requirements of the version-2 definition of the Impact Line prototype : Exampte 6 : B ~z~ @ ~ ~ ~B~ PNSubj &lt; ll4 N+Prt ( Ad j ) Hitachi/manuf./ptoce American ~t~ -~ NP large/computer/maker =~b~ F ./~F~ ( HP ) PN Hewlett Packard Co.

One needs to discuss first , however , the notion of template `` default '' fills. Default fills can be classified as either de jure , de facto , or logical. De jure defaults include the top-level or TEMPLATE OBJECT fills , such as the DOC-NR , DOC-DATE and DOC-SOURCE , whose slots ore filled by SGML-togged data items. They ore , what one might call , `` gimmes '' by design and , therefore , are not incorporated in the scoring algorithm that measures system performance. The de facto and logical defaults need some explanation. De facto defaults correspond to those set fills instantiated with a very high percentage of one type of data. Judging by actual systems ' output and the patterns of certain answer-key template fills , no one will dispute that , in the end , data fetl out of text into some set fills at a much higher frequency than was intuited originottywhen the template was being designed , s Below is o snapshot of highpercentage 33V test-set set fills. ( The second figure represents percentages for 100 randomly selected development-set articles. ) design time over the course of pr ( x~essing approximately 50 articles became blurred unavoidably as the fill rules evolved. Therefore , the initial random distribution between , e.g. , the ENTITY TYPE set fills of COMPANY , GOVERNMENT , INDIVIDUAL , and OTHER became lopsided in favor</definiens>
				<definiens id="6">seem to offer evidence for this. Every system evaluated on the TIPSTER JJV test corpus for MUC-S showed substantially lower error rates for each of the above set fills versus their overall ( A11-Objects ) error scores. SYSTIEENTIRELER OVERTEM UP TY 2-TOSTATALL STATTYPE i US ERROR US I 28 28 35 33 54 2 47 42 51 49 72 3 40 37 46 45 63 4 47 48 45 45 70 S 56 46 53 51 70 6 25 26 35 31 S @ The descriptive analysis of the 12 templates mentioned above in METHODOLOGY shows a similarly distinctive trend in actuaI systems ' output. The 12 templates were not randomly selected : All of them meet the version-1 definition for the Impact Line prototype , and only four do not meet the restrictive one ; six articles are short -six lines or less in length ; one article specifies three principal tie-up partners in the Impact Line rather than the usual two ; two articles contain multiple tie-ups rather than the usual ( 84 % of JJV test corpus ) one tie-up ; one article specifically mentions the formation of a 3V company in the Impact Line ; two Impact Lines introduce a principal tie-up entity marked by the topic marker `` wa '' that is clausally modified by the name of its parent company ; and one article 's Impact Line marks two tie-up entities. In short , whenever a correct ENTITY was instantiated by any system , the above-mentioned default fills cascaded throughout the template , even if -practically speaking -the resulting fills indicated that a lone COMPANY was in o CURRENT PARTNER relationship with itself. The discussion of article 1528 below shows such an instance of this. Other template fills con be regarded as logical defaults , or those that ore o logical consequence of the template object-oriented design. If the keyword ~teikei '' confirms that there is a tie-up and its status is , as mentioned above EXISTING , then obviously the template has o tie-up event</definiens>
